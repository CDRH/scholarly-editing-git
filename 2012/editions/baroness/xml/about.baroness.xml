            <p>The DTD (Documente Type Definition) used in this project was created from the TEI P5 poetry base with tagsets for linking, figures, analysis, transcr, textcrit.</p>

            <div><head type="main">The Interface</head>
            <p>
                The <ref type="url" target="http://v-machine.org">Versioning Machine</ref> (VM) interface used for this edition is based on version 4.0. The VM publishing and analysis platform has been updated to include two styling packages containing XSLT, CSS and JavaScript scripts, which leverage the scholar's underlying TEI P5 encoding to transform the texts into an HTML interface. By using both location-referenced and parallel segmentation methods described in the TEI P5 critical apparatus tag set, scholars can use the new VM to show alternative choices within a document and describe both line-by-line comparisons (with parallel segmentation) alongside comparisons of "chunks" of text (with location-referenced encoding) that cross over line boundaries and break traditional hierarchical encoding structures. By using the VM, scholars are creating pop-up notes and links between lines and chunks of texts, which colleagues, students, and other interested users can click to access the scholar's underlying encoded and annotated relationships.
