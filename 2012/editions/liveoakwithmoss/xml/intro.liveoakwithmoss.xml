                <div>
            <p>Walt Whitman's twelve-poem "Live Oak, with Moss" sequence, composed in the 
                late 1850s then broken up and dispersed by the poet among thirty-three other poems 
                for the "Calamus" cluster of the third (1860) edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of
                    Grass</hi>, was first printed in 1953 by Fredson Bowers in the journal 
                <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi>, and it is now available in 
                several literature anthologies and collections of Whitman's writings.<ptr 
                    target="#note1" xml:id="nr1" n="1" /> Apparently inspired by a failed same-sex attachment 
                and its psychological aftermath, "Live Oak, with Moss" was neglected for forty years 
                after Bowers reassembled the sequence from Whitman's surviving manuscripts for the 
                1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>. But it became the subject of critical and editorial 
                controversy in the 1990s, when Alan Helms printed the sequence from the revised 
                "Calamus" versions of the twelve poems and Hershel Parker edited the sequence from the manuscript, 
                with both proponents defending their versions in the journal 
                <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth-Century Literature</hi>.<ptr target="#note2"
                    xml:id="nr2" n="2" /> In that exchange, Parker's argument for the manuscript version prevailed, 
                and it has rightly served as the basis for subsequent printings&#8212;most 
                recently Betsy Erkkila's version of the poems alongside photo-facsimile 
                reproductions of the manuscript leaves (see note 1). Yet Erkkila's unqualified 
                reference to the leaves as "clean and elegantly handwritten" (xii) typifies an ongoing 
                failure by editors adequately to consider the state of the "Live Oak" manuscript. 
                Whereas his initial inscription of this work can indeed be described as clean and elegant, Whitman's 
                clear and present revisions to the leaves raise significant questions about the form 
                of the sequence and his evolving intentions for its twelve poems. As I will demonstrate 
                in this essay, Bowers's editorial focus on the final versions of the sundered manuscripts 
                was not well suited for "Live Oak, with Moss," and the approach has resulted in the incorporation 
                of changes that Whitman made to the poems after breaking the sequence apart. Along with 
                detailing the transmission of the sequence in manuscript, this essay concludes with an 
                edition of "Live Oak, with Moss" that restores the sequence to its original, integrated 
                state. The restorative edition more accurately conveys the themes and intentions that 
                inform "Live Oak, with Moss," and more clearly illustrates its significance in the 
                development of Whitman's thought.</p></div>

            <p>"Live Oak, with Moss" presents a challenging situation for scholarly editing. Its twelve
                poems were inscribed fairly by Whitman into a notebook he assembled by folding a 
                stack of eleven paper sheets into conjugate halves and stitching them together at 
                two points along the folds, producing 22 leaves.<ptr target="#note3" xml:id="nr3"
                    n="3" /> As Bowers discovered in his work on the surviving manuscripts for the 1860 edition 
                of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, the "Live Oak" notebook leaves are clearly 
                distinguishable from other drafts of the published "Calamus" poems by their Roman numeral 
                headings and by the contours where they were originally folded and stitched 
                (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> lxv-lxvi; see <ref type="figure">figure 1<figure>

                            where the sheet was originally folded and stitched to others.</p>
                        <figDesc>Notebook leaf 3, displaying Poem II of "Live Oak, with Moss" (right), and the

                            where the sheet was originally folded and stitched to others.

                        <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.17"/>
                    </figure></ref>). 
                Whitman inscribed the sequence on the rectos of leaves 2 through 18 of the notebook in 
                continuous fashion, with successive poems starting where previous ones concluded. Its 
                fair-copy notebook state represents the final form of "Live Oak, with Moss" as a stable 
                and integrated sequence, for Whitman's decision to disassemble the notebook began a new 
                phase of transmission in which the poems reverted to draft status and were combined with 
                others for the formation of a larger work. He dismantled the notebook by separating its 
                folded leaves from one another and severing these at their folds into conjugate halves. 
                This was followed by further division of some individual halves and the pasting of those 
                scissored portions to others so as to reconstitute poems that had originally occupied 
                multiple notebook leaves. For example, Poem VI of the sequence ("What think you I have 
                taken my pen to record?") originally extended from the lower section of notebook leaf 10
                (containing lines 1-3) to the upper section of leaf 11 (containing lines 4 and 5).
                Following dismantlement, Whitman cut leaves 10 and 11 in half and pasted their
                respective lower and upper sections together, creating a new leaf that contained all
                five lines (see <ref type="figure">figure 2<figure>

                </figure></ref>).
                Whitman foliated the detached leaves at their lower left corners, thereby documenting 
                their former notebook order, but he also began rearranging the "Live Oak" poems into 
                different groupings, as revealed by holes at their tops and centers where he pinned and 
                threaded leaves together, and where he appears also to have tacked groups to a surface 
                at his workspace (see <ref type="figure">figure 3<figure>
                        <head>Figure 3: Lower half of notebook leaf 11</head>

                        <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.19"/>
                    </figure></ref>).<ptr target="#note4" xml:id="nr4" n="4" /></p>
            <p>Eventually Whitman had the poems set up in type, with many others, at the Brooklyn
                printing firm operated by his friends, T. H. Rome and Brothers, with proofs made for
                the author.<ptr target="#note5" xml:id="nr5" n="5" /> In this preliminary proof stage, 
                Whitman completed the process of dispersing the poems among thirty-three others for 
                the "Calamus" cluster of the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> (the original 
                manuscripts remained with the Rome Brothers), thereby publishing all of the twelve "Live 
                Oak" poems, but not as a sequence, and in a way that destroyed their narrative of love, 
                loss, and resolve. Throughout the sundered manuscript and proof stages, Whitman made 
                revisions to the poems. Displaying various cancellations and interlineations, the 
                manuscripts reveal multiple stages of pencil and ink revision, and, in the instance 
                of Poem III ("When I heard at the close of day"), a substantial paste-over revision. 
                Although the Rome proof sheets are not known to be extant, Bowers demonstrated that 
                Whitman revised these still further before submitting them with other material to the Boston 
                firm of Thayer and Eldridge as printer's copy for the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi> 
                (xxiv); for the published "Calamus" texts of the twelve poems vary at numerous points 
                from the revised texts of the "Live Oak" manuscripts.<ptr target="#note6" xml:id="nr6" n="6" /></p>
            <p>It is easy to see why a focus on late revisions might seem to offer a reliable method
                for editing "Live Oak, with Moss." As formulated by Sir Walter Greg in 1950, the
                editorial principle of final authorial intention distinguishes among early and late
                versions of a literary work and observes authorial revisions leading up to its final
                    state.<ptr target="#note7" xml:id="nr7" n="7" /> Despite what seems to have been
                his original intention of preserving the sequence in manuscript, Whitman went on to
                publish revised versions of its twelve poems, and the changes made to them for
                inclusion in the 1860 "Calamus" cluster are clearly authorial. Their states of
                authorized finality seem to have underlain Helms's decision to assemble his edition of
                "Live Oak, with Moss" from the printed "Calamus" versions of the twelve poems, for
                although Helms does not invoke Greg's rationale, he does identify the "Calamus"
                versions as the texts "Whitman approved for publication" ("Whitman's 'Live Oak with
                Moss'" 187). The problem with Helms's decision is that the versions he reprinted were
                approved by Whitman as parts of the published "Calamus" cluster, not as the
                unpublished "Live Oak, with Moss." As Parker observed, "Greg's theory of final
                authorial intention does not apply to poems that have been taken apart from a
                sequence and then shuffled, in revised form, among other poems" as parts of a
                different work ("Commentary" 416). What Helms did was arrange the twelve revised
                "Calamus" versions of the poems in the sequential order of their manuscript states
                as an earlier work. He did not print "Live Oak, with Moss." In editing the sundered 
                manuscripts of the poems, Parker came much closer to the state of the sequence as 
                Whitman inscribed it. Yet his version in the 4th edition of the  
                <hi rend="italic">Norton Anthology of American Literature</hi> and all subsequent 
                editions of the sequence currently in print have tended to represent Whitman's manuscript 
                readings in their final states&#8212;an approach paralleling that of Bowers for his version 
                in <hi rend="italic">SB</hi>.<ptr target="#note8" xml:id="nr8" n="8" /> Bowers, of course, is so 
                thoroughly identified with Greg's principle of final authorial intention that its practice 
                has been known for the past half-century as the "Greg-Bowers" formula, which is justly 
                esteemed for producing some of the finest scholarly editions in existence. But aside from its 
                observance of late revisions, the edition of "Live Oak, with Moss" Bowers published 
                fails ultimately to exemplify the principle. Although he had already endorsed Greg's 
                rationale in 1950,<ptr target="#note9" xml:id="nr9" n="9" /> Bowers did not refer to it 
                in his 1953 essay on "Live Oak, with Moss," nor indeed to any editorial formula aimed at 
                representing Whitman's intentions for the sequence.</p>
            <p>The absence of a principled editorial approach in "Whitman's Original Manuscripts for
                the 'Calamus' Poems" is curiously out of keeping with the significance of the
                discoveries disclosed by Bowers. In his essay he observed: (1) that the twelve "Live
                Oak" poems "make up an artistically complete story of attachment, crisis, and
                reconstitution"; (2) that they "are manifestly fair copies" in their original
                inscriptions; and (3) that "the calamus symbol is nowhere mentioned in these poems,"
                which instead feature the live oak (264). These three points establish the autonomy
                of the sequence during its notebook state as a discretely inscribed work, one
                Whitman wrote under what were apparently compelling biographical circumstances.
                Whitman's motives for recording the sequence may be suggested by his note on the
                verso of a canceled draft fragment of Poem II, "I saw in Louisiana a live-oak
                growing": <quote>
                    <l>A cluster of poems, sonnets expressing the thoughts, pictures,&#8212;aspirations, &amp;c.</l>
                    <l>Fit to be perused during the days of the approach of Death.</l>
                    <l>That I have prepared myself for that purpose.</l>
                    <l>Remember now&#8212;</l>
                    <l>Remember then&#8212;<ptr target="#note10" xml:id="nr10" n="10" /></l>
                </quote>As Bowers surmised of this note, "the reference to Whitman having himself prepared the 
                cluster is very likely to his having assembled and copied out the poems in a form to 
                be kept by him" (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> lxvii). Several details 
                supply strong indication that the designated cluster was "Live Oak, with Moss" and that 
                the form in question was the "Live Oak" notebook. Occupying different sides of the same 
                leaf, the note and draft fragment display a documentary connection between Whitman's
                reference to a commemorative cluster of poems and the title poem of "Live Oak, with Moss." 
                Whereas Whitman's surviving papers furnish many examples of recto/verso inscriptions
                that lack clear genetic relationships, his revisions to the canceled recto draft are 
                observed exactly in the notebook inscription of Poem II, indicating the leaf served as 
                copy for the notebook version. Whitman subsequently canceled the draft with a vertical 
                line, and the order of draft inscription and cancellation (on the recto, where the draft 
                is cropped along a verse line at the leaf's head) followed by note inscription (on the 
                verso, where the note is neatly situated with no content lost to cropping) makes it likely 
                that Whitman's act of inscribing the note followed his act of transcribing the fair-copy 
                version of "Live Oak, with Moss." The note's reference to an already "prepared" collection 
                of poems may therefore aptly signify the "Live Oak" notebook&#8212;a medium well suited for 
                keepsake purposes. Identification of the memorial cluster with "Live Oak, with Moss" seems further 
                bolstered by aspects of the inscribed sequence that are manifestly autobiographical, such 
                as its retrospective account of Whitman's ambition to become America's representative 
                poet&#8212;an ambition he there abandons in preference for intimate love and companionship.</p>
            <p>Whatever the intentions surrounding his note about having prepared a cluster for perusal 
                in old age, the fair-copy state of its inscription reveals that Whitman completed "Live 
                Oak, with Moss" in its notebook form. But Bowers's descriptions of the sundered manuscripts 
                display undue emphasis on the radically different fate of the "Live Oak" poems as dispersed 
                and shuffled components of a later work. Despite his recognition of the sequence as an
                artistically complete product that predated Whitman's conception of "Calamus," he
                described "Live Oak, with Moss" as "the inception of the 'Calamus' cluster and the
                original poems which comprised it," and he published his research as "Whitman's
                Manuscripts for the Original 'Calamus' Poems" (257). This tendency to conceive of the
                "Live Oak" poems in terms that look forward to their published states demonstrably
                influenced Bowers's editing of the sequence. His most revealing decision along these
                lines was his adherence to a revision in the manuscript of Poem II, "I saw in
                Louisiana a live-oak growing," which portrays the speaker meditating about the
                tree's resemblance to himself. As originally inscribed on leaf 4 of the intact
                notebook (the second leaf of Poem II), lines 6 through 8 of the poem convey
                Whitman's sense of "Live Oak, with Moss" as an integrated whole organized around its
                titular symbol: <quote>
                    <l>And I plucked a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined
                        around it a little moss, and brought it away&#8212;And I have placed it
                        in sight in my room,</l>
                    <l>It is not needed to remind me as of my friends, (for I believe lately I think
                        of little else than of them,)</l>
                    <l>Yet it remains to me a curious token&#8212;I write these pieces, and name
                        them after it; (2.6-8)</l>
                </quote>The revision in question involves Whitman's decision to strike the final
                two clauses, "I write these pieces, and name them after it," and interline above the
                canceled words the clause, "it makes me think of manly love." To perform the revision, 
                Whitman used a light brown ink he also used to cancel the title "Live Oak, with Moss" 
                on what had been the opening leaf of the sequence and supply above it the title 
                "Calamus-Leaves" (see <ref type="figure">figure 4<figure>
 			<head>Figure 4: Brown ink revisions</head>
 			<p>Brown ink cancellation of the title, "Live Oak, with Moss," and corresponding revision to Poem II.</p>
                    <figDesc>Brown ink cancellation of the title, "Live Oak, with Moss," and corresponding

                    <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.20"/>
                </figure></ref>).
                Whitman's replacement of the title "Live Oak, with Moss" by "Calamus-Leaves" and his 
                cancellation in Poem II are the only two instances of light brown ink revisions in the 
                "Live Oak" manuscript. According to Bowers's inclusive examination of Whitman's manuscripts 
                for the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, the light brown medium represents "the final 
                or near-to-final" transmission stage for the entire mass of manuscripts Whitman surrendered 
                to the printing firm of T. H. Rome and Brothers (xxvii). Shortly before relinquishing the 
                mss, Whitman used grades of the same brown ink to inscribe new opening poems for the now-assembled 
                "Calamus" cluster, which in Bowers's words "performed for the calamus what poems I and II 
                had done for the live oak as an association" (lxx). Whitman also used the brown ink for a section 
                introducing the theme of companionship to the already drafted "Premonition" (published as 
                "Proto-Leaf" in the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">Whitman's 
                Manuscripts</hi> 12). The presence of the light brown ink in the manuscripts thus corresponds 
                in time with Whitman's decision to publish an "evangel-poem of lovers and comrades," as he 
                described "Calamus" in the material he added to "Premonition" (12), and post-dates his dismantlement 
                of the "Live Oak" notebook and dispersal of its poems among others for the newly conceived 
                cluster. The related content of the revisions suggests further that the two brown-ink 
                changes were performed in relation to each other after Whitman conceived of a new controlling 
                image&#8212;the calamus plant&#8212;for a larger poetic cluster that would incorporate the 
                "Live Oak" poems. Yet although Bowers restored the title "Live Oak, with Moss" to his edition 
                of the sequence, he let stand Whitman's collateral substitution of "It makes me think of manly 
                love" for "I write these pieces, and name them after it." Bowers's edition therefore prints 
                the sequence under its correct title, but it omits Poem II's reference to that title, and to 
                the poems themselves as a collective whole.</p>
            <p>Whereas Bowers's adherence to the principle of final authorial intention can be seen
                in his declared but unexplained decision to print the manuscripts "in the final
                versions of their texts" (259), the influence of Greg's principle on his edition of
                "Live Oak, with Moss" was clearly conceptual rather than methodological. For the
                purpose of capturing a stand-alone work from manuscripts later absorbed within a
                larger one, a precise application of the principle of final authorial intention
                would require the editor to identify their final states as the product of that
                original intention, observing only revisions made by the author up to that point.
                But along with neglecting to provide a justification for final versions, Bowers
                chose not to address the question of whether different revisions in the manuscript
                could be associated with Whitman's differing intentions for these poems, first, as
                an integrated sequence and, later, as parts of a larger work. Indeed, Bowers's
                decision to print the final versions "without notes as to the originals of the
                various revisions contained in them" (260) reveals that his essay was designedly
                reportorial rather than analytical. He seems to have conceived of the sequence as
                illuminating a significant stage in the genetic history of "Calamus," but not as
                warranting critical establishment of a copy-text for reprinting and anthologization
                of "Live Oak, with Moss." Although he described the sequence as "artistically
                complete," its superseded status apparently exempted it from consideration as a work
                requiring thorough bibliographic investigation in its own right.</p>
            <p>Bowers described his 1953 essay as a "preview and synopsis" and announced that "the
                bare bones of this present story will be fleshed with the proper evidence when the
                full texts and their appropriate introductions are published" (257), and he did go
                on to identify material and textual features of the "Live Oak" manuscripts in his
                1955 monograph <hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass (1860)</hi>.
                But there again he restricted his analysis of the manuscripts to their status as
                early drafts of "Calamus" poems. He did not print the "Live Oak, with Moss" poems in
                their sequential order, nor did he take up the question of how their revisions
                should be classified in relation to Whitman's radical transmission of the poems from
                one work to another. In a revealing slip, he there even referred to the "Live Oak"
                notebook as "the 'Calamus' notebook" (lxviii).<ptr target="#note11" xml:id="nr11"
                    n="11" /> His focus on the poems as early drafts of "Calamus" likely contributed
                to neglect of "Live Oak, with Moss" over the decades that followed, for we see it
                influencing dismissive reactions to his discovery that the poems had originally
                constituted an earlier work. James E. Miller, Jr., concluded from Bowers's research
                that the existence of "Live Oak, with Moss" had been "tenuous" from the start, and
                David Cavitch concluded that in the act of inscribing the sequence Whitman had
                merely "toyed" with arranging "Calamus" poems into a smaller cluster.<ptr
                    target="#note12" xml:id="nr12" n="12" /> These attitudes characterized criticism
                for four decades despite the significance of Whitman's original collective reference
                to the sequence in Poem II, despite its fair-copy state, and despite the compelling
                implications of Whitman's note on the draft fragment of Poem II&#8212;all of
                which evidence predates Whitman's adoption of the calamus image for a larger work
                that would incorporate the twelve sundered poems.<ptr target="#note13" xml:id="nr13"
                    n="13" /></p>
            <p>Long-standing neglect of "Live Oak, with Moss" has been attributed to discomfort with
                its subject matter and to its limited circulation in a specialized bibliographical
                journal. But considerable explanation may also be found in the conceptual approach
                that has dictated its form to date. Its appearance in modern literary collections
                means it is now being conceived not merely as the "first and limited form of
                'Calamus'" (Bowers, <hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> xxxvi), but as the
                outcome of quite different earlier intentions. Whether or not we associate "Live
                Oak, with Moss" with Whitman's declared intent to privately commemorate matters of
                personal experience, there is no denying the fair-copy state of its notebook
                inscription, and its status as a completed manuscript warrants analytical
                bibliographic treatment. But the version of "Live Oak, with Moss" currently in print
                is not a product of bibliographic analysis. It is a blanket transcription of the final 
                versions of the manuscripts that restores the title of the sequence but indiscriminately 
                observes every other revision to its twelve poems. Continuing acceptance and application 
                of this approach is newly displayed in the most recent edition by Betsy Erkkila, who 
                prints the final states of the texts alongside facsimile reproductions of the manuscript 
                leaves but does not address their revisions and does not explain her editorial procedure.<ptr target="#note14"
                    xml:id="nr14" n="14" /></p>
            <p>"Live Oak, with Moss" should be edited not by representing the latest revised versions 
                of its dispersed manuscripts, but by restoring it as closely as possible to the state 
                in which it was inscribed as an integrated work. Restoration is made possible by revisory 
                ink offsetting and bleeding in the original notebook leaves, and by connections of this 
                evidence to the hinge points where notebook leaves were originally folded and stitched 
                and to pinholes where Whitman reattached leaves of individual poems during the revision 
                stages that followed dismantlement. The rest of the present study details the "Live Oak, 
                with Moss" notebook as it was originally assembled and dismantled, distinguishes revisions 
                Whitman made to the poems during their notebook existence from those he made following 
                dismantlement, and supplies a new edition of "Live Oak, with Moss" that recaptures the 
                notebook state of its text.</p>

                 <p>The following table updates and expands tabular data in Bowers's <hi rend="italic">Whitman's 
                     Manuscripts</hi> (lxiv-lxv), listing the leaves of Whitman's "Live Oak, with Moss" notebook
                along with details of their order, content, and composition in connected and separated states. 
                It adopts Bowers's "<hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1" designation for the white wove paper of
                which the notebook was assembled by Whitman, with "<hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1a"
                signifying leaves 1 through 11 of the notebook, and "<hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b"
                signifying their conjugate leaves 12 through 22. Die stamps at the lower right
                corners of leaves 18, 19, and 20 show this paper to be from the mill of Owen
                &amp; Hurlbut Paper Company in South Lee, Massachusetts. The total of 22
                conjugate halves from 11 folded sheets of paper corrects Bowers's tally of 20 leaves
                from 10 sheets (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> lxiv-lxv), and so
                assigns different numbers to the leaves and their conjugate mates. The table and ensuing 
                analysis also observe Bowers's designation of a black ink fair-copy inscription, with black 
                and brown ink revisions, although the mediums are not always easily distinguished. It 
                may be that some of the color variations constitute not separate inks but different 
                grades of the same medium. Such variations could have resulted from differences of 
                consistency in Whitman's ink well at different work stages and&#8212;as his light brown
                revisions might indicate&#8212;from dilutions performed by Whitman for the purpose of 
                stretching out his supply. All of the "Live Oak" poems were inscribed by Whitman on 
                the rectos of the notebook leaves, of which the versos were left blank.</p>

            <p>In describing Whitman's notebook as consisting of 20 leaves, Bowers concluded that
                the opening poem of the sequence was inscribed on leaf 1 and that the final Poem XII
                was inscribed on leaf 17, with the notebook's remaining three <hi rend="small-caps"
                    >w</hi>1b leaves left blank. After dismantlement, Whitman used two of these <hi
                    rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b leaves to inscribe the poems that would become
                "Calamus" Nos. 44 and 38 (leaf 19 in the above table) and No. 39 (leaf 20) in
                brown ink (see <ref type="figure">figures 5<figure>

                Bowers identified the upper half of the remaining third 
                <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b leaf (leaf 22) as Whitman's paste-over revision 
                to manuscript leaf 7 of "So Long!," and assumed its lower half to be lost 
                (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> lxvii). But the surviving evidence 
                shows Bowers's account to be flawed. The paste-over revision to "So Long!" is indeed 
                from a <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b notebook leaf, but that leaf's lower half is 
                present among Whitman's surviving manuscripts. Inverted from its original notebook orientation, 
                it exists as a paste-over revised opening affixed by Whitman to a draft that would 
                become "Calamus" No. 18, "City of my walks and joys" (see <ref type="figure">figures 7<figure>

                The contour of its scissored bottom edge corresponds with the bottom edge of the paste-over
                revision to "So Long!" and trim marks at its right edge correspond with the right
                edges of all of the surviving <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b leaves. (Their lower-right 
                jagged edges indicate the 11 notebook sheets that formed the "Live Oak" notebook were 
                originally among the end-sheets of a stack of paper that was too thick to allow a clean 
                cut.) Most tellingly, a crease and two pinholes at the left of the paste-over on "Calamus" 
                No. 18 and at the right of the paste-over on leaf 7 of "So Long" correspond with the areas 
                where the notebook sheets were originally folded and stitched, and thus identify them as 
                having once been parts of a notebook leaf.</p>
            <p>The two paste-overs together constitute the final leaf of the "Live Oak" notebook,
                but unlike other surviving notebook leaves, the one affixed to "Calamus" No. 18
                retains a considerable portion of its conjugate half. Contrary to Bowers's
                assumptions, this does not match the internal edge of Poem I of the "Live Oak"
                sequence (leaf 2 in the above table). It must therefore be identified as the <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b
                conjugate half of the actual leaf 1, now unlocated along with <hi rend="small-caps"
                    >w</hi>1b leaf 21, which was the actual conjugate half of leaf 2. It is of 
                course no surprise that Whitman would have used opening and 
                closing leaves as a cover for the notebook and commenced his inscription of "Live 
                Oak, with Moss" on its second leaf rather than on its first. In all likelihood the 
                opening leaf was left blank, for pen strokes in the light brown ink of Whitman's 
                late revisions can be seen at the severed edges of the "Calamus" No. 
                18 and "So Long!" paste-overs, which indicates that Whitman used leaf 1 for some 
                form of inscription after he detached it from the notebook, but before he separated 
                its conjugate half for the paste-over revisions to those poems.</p>
            <p>The above evidence establishes that Whitman's original "Live Oak, with Moss" notebook
                consisted of 22 leaves, with the sequence inscribed on the rectos of leaves 2
                through 18. Leaves 19, 20, and 22 were left blank and used by Whitman for
                inscription of different verses after the notebook was dismantled, as were in all
                likelihood the lost leaves 1 and 21. However, inscription of the sequence into the
                notebook appears not to have been carried out in a single stage or sitting. On the
                originally constituted leaf 13 (which Whitman later severed), and positioned in the
                very midst of the second line of Poem VIII ("Hours continuing long"), an erased
                pencil notation in Whitman's hand reads: "finished in the other city" (see <ref type="figure">figure 9<figure>
 			<head>Figure 9: Section of notebook leaf 13</head>
 			<p>Section of notebook leaf 13, displaying opening lines of Poem VIII and (through enhanced imaging)

                    <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.75"/>
                </figure></ref>). 
                The note appears to have been inscribed before Poem VIII was added to this leaf, but 
                after Whitman had inscribed the closing line of Poem VII ("You bards of ages hence!")
                    at its head.<ptr target="#note15" xml:id="nr15" n="15" /> In other words, Whitman's 
                inscription of Poem VII continued from leaf 12 to the top of leaf 13, beneath which he 
                recorded in pencil that the inscription was "finished in the other city"&#8212;a reference 
                probably to Manhattan, as distinct from Whitman's resident city of Brooklyn (not consolidated
                with New York City until 1898). But he subsequently erased the notation and went on
                to inscribe Poems VIII through XII onto this and succeeding leaves, recording line 2
                of Poem VIII directly over the erasure. Additional evidence that an interval
                occurred at this point in the inscription consists of the fact that Whitman at first
                mistakenly recorded the numeral "IX" as a heading for Poem VIII, and that he was
                obliged to strike the erroneous heading and supply "VIII" beside it. Numeral
                headings of the remaining poems follow accurately from the correction, which reveals
                Whitman spotted the error before continuing the inscription of "Live Oak, with Moss"
                beyond Poem VIII.<ptr target="#note16" xml:id="nr16" n="16" /></p>
            <p> Whitman's temporary decision to finish the notebook inscription with Poem VII is difficult 
                to explain. In Poems I through VII, the speaker distinguishes his capacity and need for 
                companionship from the self-sufficiency of the natural world, and renounces his role 
                as national poet for "him who loves me, as I him, in perfect love" (5.9). The speaker's 
                rejections of nature and nation in favor of love and companionship culminate in Poem VII, 
                where he demands of posterity that he be remembered not as a great poet but as the 
                "tenderest lover" (7.4). Ending the sequence with Poem VII's triumphant endorsement of 
                private companionship would have produced an expression remarkably different from the one 
                he went on to complete as "Live Oak, with Moss." Moreover, it would also have lacked the 
                coherence of the 12-poem cluster. The ebullience of Poem VII is qualified toward its conclusion 
                by the speaker's expressed fear that his lover may actually be "indifferent" to him&#8212;a 
                topic that would have been left undeveloped if Whitman had finished inscription with this 
                poem. For it is in the following Poem VIII ("Hours continuing long") that the speaker tells 
                of being rejected by his lover and describes his ensuing grief in moving detail. The remaining 
                four poems inscribed by Whitman into the notebook illustrate the speaker's emergence from his 
                grief as a newly anointed prophet of "manly love"&#8212;first with a visionary experience that 
                introduces the expression (Poem IX), and finally with the intent to "engraft" this principle upon 
                a disciple who is receptive to his teaching (Poem XII). This horticultural reference recalls 
                the speaker's action in Poem II of plucking a twig from the live oak tree as a token for the 
                meaning of the sequence and contributes to the thematic unity of the work. The movement from 
                heartache to resolve suggests a process of sublimation that would result in the published 
                "Calamus" cluster. Indeed, with the late brown ink he used to re-title the sequence, 
                Whitman went on to inscribe the poem that became "Calamus" No. 39 on leaf 20 of the 
                dismantled "Live Oak" notebook. "Calamus" No. 39 expresses similar principles of visionary 
                compensation and resolve (see <ref type="figure">figure 6<figure>

                That Whitman commenced inscription with the intention of including all twelve poems seems 
                likely from the number of leaves he folded and stitched together for his notebook. A shorter 
                notebook would have sufficed if he had planned to copy out a sequence comprising only the 
                first seven. Whatever the reasons for the pause, Whitman resumed inscription and completed 
                his fair-copy version of all twelve poems under the title, "Live Oak, with Moss."</p>
            <p>The act of dismantlement corresponded with or led to Whitman's new conception of the twelve
                poems as parts of a different cluster, one to which he would devote at least two of
                the remaining blank notebook leaves for three new poems, and in which he would develop 
                the equation of love and camaraderie with universal vision.<ptr
                    target="#note18" xml:id="nr18" n="18" /> In foliating the sixteen separated
                notebook leaves, Whitman documented the fair-copy order of the poems. But the
                assortment of holes among the leaves reveals they underwent various groupings in
                their detached states. In processes of perusal and revision Whitman attached,
                detached and reattached the loose leaves of individual poems at different times by
                pinning them together at their centers, at their center heads, and at their upper
                left corners. Additional holes along the tops of all the leaves and in the centers
                of some indicate they were tacked to a surface&#8212;presumably the
                wall by Whitman's work space (see note 4 and <ref type="figure">figure 3<figure>
                        <head>Figure 3: Lower half of notebook leaf 11</head>
                        <p>Lower half of notebook leaf 11, displaying thread and holes.</p>
                        <figDesc>Lower half of notebook leaf 11, displaying thread and holes.

                        <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.19"/>
                    </figure></ref>). 
                But in no instance can these holes be said to align on all of the leaves that comprise 
                the original sequence, and a considerable difference in the quantities of holes at the 
                heads of leaves 2 through 8 and leaves 9 through 18 would seem to indicate that Whitman 
                divided the poems into two or more groups. A pattern of twelve holes with duplicate spatial 
                relationships occurs on leaves 9-18, among other holes that are not a part of the pattern. 
                A surviving strand of thread in one of these twelve holes at the corner of leaf 11 suggests 
                Whitman once stitched these leaves together along their heads into a single group. It is odd 
                that the sequence of threaded holes commences on leaf 9, for this leaf constitutes the second 
                leaf of Poem V (displaying lines 6 through 11), of which the beginning leaf 8 displays only five 
                pin and tack holes at its head and two at its upper left corner, none of which correspond with 
                the threaded pattern on leaves 9 through 18 (see <ref type="figure">figure 10<figure>

            <p> Poem I displays only a single tack hole at its head (as distinct from pin holes created by its being 
                pinned to other leaves), and nine at its center. Poem I was at one point pinned together at the center 
                with Poem II, as were possibly Poems XI and XII. But matching glue vestiges on the right verso edge of 
                Poem XI (leaf 17), on the left recto and right verso of what would become "Calamus" 37 ("A leaf for 
                hand-in-hand!"), and on the left recto edge of Poem XII (leaf 18) reveal Whitman's temporary grouping 
                of these three poems in that order at some point after disassembly of the notebook

                A matching pattern of tack holes in the center of Poem I and the center of what
                would become "Calamus" 2 ("Scented herbage of my breast") suggests Whitman combined
                these two temporarily as well when he was still conceiving of "Not the heat flames
                up and consumes" as an introductory poem that would commence the larger cluster he
                projected as "Calamus-Leaves." The variation of pin and tack holes among the leaves 
                shows that although Whitman grouped numbers of the twelve poems together,
                he also combined them with new poems and did not regroup all twelve in this manner 
                after dismantlement. As Bowers noted, emendations in the foliation suggest that 
                Whitman considered alternative arrangements in the process of numbering the leaves 
                at their lower left corners (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi>
                lxvi). Whereas the foliation documents the original notebook order of
                the poems, it does not indicate their reconstitution as a sequence during this
                revisory work stage of their history.</p></div>

            <p> The evidence of shuffling and dispersal indicates that the "Live Oak, with Moss" 
                sequence quickly lost integrity following Whitman's dismantlement of the notebook. 
                In that earlier form it assumed its most stable state as a discretely inscribed work, 
                whereas in disassembly the poems commenced new stages of revision, transmission, and

            <p>Whitman's ink revisions to the poems of "Live Oak, with Moss" are here classified as
                follows: 1) black ink emendations made in the process of its fair copy inscription;
                2) black ink revisions possibly made after initial inscription but demonstrably before 
                dismantlement; 3) black and brown ink revisions made to the poems after dismantlement; 
                4) black ink revisions that cannot with certainty be identified as preceding or following 
                dismantlement. Returning the poems as closely as possible to their notebook states requires 
                observance of ink revisions classified as 1, 2, and 4, and restoration of original wording 
                altered or canceled by Whitman in class 3 revisions. Class 1 revisions consist of in-line 
                emendations Whitman made to errors he committed while copying the sequence into the notebook 
                from drafts. These include corrections Whitman made by wiping away the wet ink of the 
                mis-written letter and inscribing the correct character at the site of the wipe (e.g. <ref type="figure">1.5 to<figure>

                and instances of direct overwriting where the nature of the error and material appearance of 
                the emendation indicate it was performed mid-inscription with the same ink (e.g. <ref type="figure">3.1 followed<figure>

                include strikeouts that correct what were apparently eye-skips, with Whitman erroneously 
                transcribing a word from his draft at the wrong point of a line in the notebook, then 
                immediately catching the error, cancelling it with diagonal pen strokes, and proceeding 
                with the correct word. Class 2 revisions consist of alterations Whitman made to leaves 4

                of the intact notebook. The first comprises two sequential changes to line 9 of Poem II: 
                Whitman's alteration of "tree" to "live oak," involving his mis-inscription of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> for <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, 
                and his emendation of the error. The second is Whitman's replacement of a comma by an 
                exclamation point at line 1 of Poem VII.<ptr target="#note19" xml:id="nr19" n="19" />  
                The ambiguous class 4 revisions consist of black-ink cancellations and/or additions made 
                by Whitman in Poems II, III, VI, VII, X, and XI (see the class 4 column in Table 2). None 
                produced offsets on the versos of leaves that had preceded them in the intact notebook, and 
                this fact alone might suggest that their leaves were detached at the time of revision. But 
                since class 4 changes cannot certainly be identified as following dismantlement, they are 
                observed in the text of the restored edition with XML encoding. All of the class 4 changes 
                can be described as stylistic in character, involving local alterations in phraseology and 
                word choice. Their neatness of execution indicates a closer relationship to Whitman's fair-copy 
                inscription than to the untidy redrafting stage of his later pencil alterations (discussed below).</p>
            <p>Class 3 revisions are identifiable as such by their ink varieties, by their offsets
                on the versos of leaves to which they were pinned after dismantlement, and, in the
                case of a paste-over revision to Poem III, by ink clouding that occurred where the
                two dismantled leaves comprising this poem were pinned together before the revisory
                ink and glue were dry.<ptr target="#note20" xml:id="nr20" n="20" /> The two brown ink
                class 3 revisions constitute Whitman's cancellation of the title "Live Oak, with Moss" 
                and substitution of "Calamus-Leaves" and his likely corresponding revision to Poem II, 
                line 8, which eliminated the poem's collective reference to the sequence. As discussed 
                above, the ink medium of both revisions associates them with a late stage of transmission 
                in Whitman's manuscripts for the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>. In addition, offsets on the 
                verso of the first leaf of Poem II from Whitman's brown ink strikeouts and interlineations 
                on the next leaf match with their origins when pinholes at the tops of the leaves are aligned rather 
                than when the notebook hinge points of the leaves are aligned (see  
                <ref type="figure">figure 13<figure>

                </figure></ref>).
                The combined evidence of ink medium and offset alignment demonstrates that the revision to 
                Poem II occurred after dismantlement.</p>
            <p>The three remaining class 3 revisions involve alterations to Poems III, V, and XI.
                The case of Poem III constitutes the most substantial change Whitman made to the
                "Live Oak" poems after disassembly, and ranks with his light brown ink alteration of
                Poem II as the most consequential for matters of critical interpretation of the
                sequence. Inscribed on notebook leaves 5 and 6, Poem III of "Live Oak, with Moss"
                begins with the speaker explaining that his experiences of fame, carousal, and
                personal accomplishment have not brought him happiness, moves on to his account of
                meeting with his lover in a natural beach setting, and concludes with his
                recollection that this meeting alone brought him joy. The original notebook version
                includes his address to the ocean waves: "And that night O you happy waters, I heard
                you beating the shores&#8212;But my heart beat happier than you&#8212;for he
                I love was returned and sleeping by my side" (3.9; see <ref type="figure">figures 14<figure>

                His subordination of natural processes to human emotional experience follows 
                consistently from similar motifs in Poems I and II, where the speaker has declared 
                that nature cannot fulfill or compare with the needs and capacities of the emotionally 
                endowed self. But Whitman changed the conclusion to Poem III with a paste-over revision 
                on white wove paper that has the speaker recollecting "the hissing rustle of the liquid 
                and sands, as directed to me, whispering, to congratulate me," thus replacing its original 
                subordinating address with a sympathetic identification between the self and nature 
                (see <ref type="figure">figure 16<figure>
 			<head>Figure 16: Paste-over revision to Poem III</head>
 			<p>Whitman's paste-over revision for lines 9-12 of Poem III on notebook leaf VI.</p>
 			<figDesc>Photograph of Whitman's paste-over revision for lines 9-12 of Poem III on notebook leaf VI.</figDesc>
                    <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.81"/>
                </figure></ref>).</p>
            <p>Bowers observed of the leaf 6 paste-over that it "seems to have been added after the
                leaf was removed from the notebook" (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi>
                lxvi), but he offered no explanation or support for this judgment. That the revision
                to Poem III was indeed undertaken by Whitman after dismantlement is revealed by
                several material details. The verso of leaf 5 displays ink offsets from the
                opening line of the paste-over revision: "And that night, while all was still, I
                heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores." In Whitman's act of
                inscribing this line, ink accumulated in the initial downward pen strokes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi>'s in the words "was" and "waters." These two points produced
                offsets when Whitman went on to pin leaves 5 and 6 back to front, with the revisory
                paste-over on the recto of leaf 6 making contact with the verso of leaf 5. Scarcity
                of additional offsets on the verso of leaf 5 indicates that by the time of contact
                the surface of the paste-over had mainly dried except for the two pen strokes that
                begin "was" and "waters," each of which commences a new line of text, and each of
                which apparently followed fresh replenishments of ink to the point of Whitman's pen
                during inscription.</p>
            <p>Matching the ink offsets from "was" and "waters" on the verso of leaf 5 with their
                origins on leaf 6 results in simultaneous alignment of both the middle pinholes of 
                these two leaves and the original notebook hinge points of the leaves; and
                therefore the spatial correspondence of offsets and pinholes does not by itself
                confirm that the paste-over revision was applied to Poem III after rather than
                before dismantlement. Post-dismantlement revision is confirmed, however, by additional
                evidence that the revisory ink was still wet beneath the surface of inscription when
                Whitman pinned the two detached notebook leaves at their middles, most especially by
                ink bleeding in the opening line of the revision where the pin penetrated the
                paste-over leaf. The pin pierced the paste-over at the apex of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> in "night," and the extra compression of the paste-over onto the
                underlying leaf at this point of pressure caused the fresh ink to mix with the wet
                layer of glue beneath, producing a cloud of diluted ink that envelopes both the <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at the end of "night" (see

                An identical effect resulted around the dot of the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in the 
                adjacent word "while" at the right of "night." Directly to the left of this central 
                point, glue was squeezed out from under the pasteover where Whitman pinched the left 
                edges of the separate leaves together while pinning them. This seepage temporarily 
                bonded the two leaves at this position, and a vestige of the glue remains on the verso 
                of leaf 5 where the bonding occurred. Each of these areas signifies a high-pressure 
                point where Whitman grasped and pinned leaves 5 and 6 at their middles. With the 
                corresponding offsets from the
                    <hi rend="italic">w</hi>'s at "was" and "waters," which also are situated in this
                vicinity where Whitman handled the leaves to pin them together, the ink clouding and
                vestigial glue supply material proof that leaves 5 and 6 were not joined at the
                hinges of an intact notebook when Whitman applied the past-over patch to Poem III, 
                but existed as separate leaves at the time of revision.<ptr target="#note21" xml:id="nr21" n="21" /></p>
            <p>Another class 3 revision occurred on leaf 8 when Whitman revised Poem V ("Long I
                thought that knowledge alone would suffice me") by striking "the examples" from the
                clause, "I heard the examples of warriors," with five diagonal black ink strokes
                (5.3). The four cancellation strokes applied to "examples" offset to the verso of the preceding
                leaf 7 when Whitman pinned the two leaves together at the top, and these offsets
                align with the original pen strokes on leaf 8 when the pinholes are aligned, but
                not when the notebook hinge points of the leaves are aligned (see <ref type="figure">figure 18<figure>

                The final class 3 revision was made by Whitman on leaf 17 to the opening line of Poem XI, 
                which in its notebook state begins "Earth! My likeness!" (11.1). Whitman cancelled the 
                expression "My likeness!" with three diagonal strokes in a black ink. The ink offset to the verso 
                of leaf 16, but the offsets fail to match with the positions of the original pen strokes when either 
                the hinge points or the pinholes are aligned (see <ref type="figure">figure 19<figure>

                    </figure></ref>). 
                In fact, the pen strokes and their offsets do not even align uniformly with one another when any one of 
                the strikeouts on leaf 17 is matched to its offset on leaf 16. Perhaps the best explanation for this 
                nonalignment is that it resulted from some modest degree of paper shuffling by Whitman when the 
                ink from the pen strokes was still wet, which itself suggests that the leaves were detached from 
                the notebook when the revision was made. Whatever the case, non-alignment between the offsets 
                and hinge points supplies conclusive proof that the leaves existed in detached states at the time 
                of revision.</p>
            <p>Whitman's ink alterations to the "Live Oak" poems display a level of care and
                neatness of execution that indicates considerable concern to preserve their neat
                appearance. But no such care is evident in his pencil alterations, in which
                cancellations appear not as precise diagonal slashes and single horizontal strikes
                but as rapidly executed cross-outs and scribbled blots (e.g., <ref type="figure">2.3 with<figure>
                        <head>Pencil revision, 2.3 with</head>

                        <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.25"/>
                    </figure></ref>). 
                The execution of pencil interlineations, too, reveals a compression of script and untidy 
                placement much more characteristic of draft status than of finalized copy (e.g., <ref type="figure">5.2 me&#8212;<figure>
                        <head>Pencil revision, 5.2 me&#8212;</head>

                        <graphic url="liveoakwithmoss.65"/>
                    </figure></ref>). 
                From his broad survey of the manuscripts in the Barrett Collection at the University of 
                Virginia, Bowers identified a revision sequence of pencil, dark ink, pencil again, and 
                brown ink (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> lii and xxvii). While additional 
                sub-stages are likely, the superseding of a class 4 black ink revision by multiple pencil 
                stages on leaf 5, Poem III (<ref type="figure">3.3 the<figure>
                        <head>Class 4 revision, 3.3 the</head>

                    </figure></ref>), 
                indicates Whitman's pencil revisions to the "Live Oak" poems can be classified as among 
                those that occurred later rather than earlier in the sequence of revision. But it is their 
                work-stage appearance that most clearly indicates Whitman had ceased to be concerned about 
                the visual appearance of the manuscripts when he made the pencil changes. They contrast 
                markedly with the fair-copy state of the ink inscription, and can be grouped with the class 
                3 ink revisions as changes that followed disassembly.</p></div>

                     <head type="small-main">Interpretive Significance of the Restorations</head>
            <p>The original "Live Oak, with Moss" sequence displays powerful thematic patterns that
                are muddled by the versions currently in print. The speaker's reference to the
                sequence as a collective whole in Poem II ("I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing") 
                would seem naturally to imply such unifying elements. But in addition to removing
                the reference itself, Whitman's brown-ink revision to this poem prematurely
                introduces the concept of "manly love" that had originally not appeared in the
                sequence until Poem IX ("I dreamed in a dream"), where it emerged with climactic 
                effect in the speaker's dream vision of a fraternal urban stronghold. Whitman, of 
                course, had no intention of diminishing this culminative impact when he made the 
                revision, for he had already disassembled the sequence and was focused instead on 
                incorporating Poem II within a larger cluster of poems. As "Calamus" No. 20, Poem 
                II has become one of Whitman's best known poems, and it is widely anthologized apart 
                from the "Calamus" cluster. Its reference to "manly love" has come to be associated 
                with his signature comradeship theme perhaps more routinely than any other line in 
                <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. But its presence in Poem II has a dampening 
                effect on the role Whitman originally intended for the concept in "Live Oak, with Moss," 
                where in Bowers's edition its early intrusion diminishes the original impact it carried 
                near the end of the sequence in Poem IX.</p>
            <p>The paste-over alteration to Poem III has similarly distorting effects when it is
                allowed to stand as a legitimate revision to "Live Oak, with Moss." At the very
                outset of the sequence in Poem I, Whitman established a motif of emotional primacy
                over nature with the speaker's avowal that "Not the heat flames up and consumes, /
                Not the sea-waves hurry in and out . . . more than the flames of me, consuming,
                burning for his love whom I love&#8212;O none, more than I, hurrying in and out"
                (1.1-4). The rhetoric of negation extends to Poem II, where the speaker distances
                himself from nature in the form of the live oak tree that stands "alone there
                without its friend, its lover&#8212;For I knew I could not" (11). The notebook
                state of Poem III follows coherently from the previous two, with the speaker
                declaring his happiness in terms that combine his subordinating conception of nature
                in Poem I and his rejection of the tree's solitary joy in Poem II (see <ref type="figure">figure 15<figure>

                These lines depict the natural world quite differently from the post-dismantlement 
                version's chorus of "liquid and sands" that directly address the speaker, "whispering to 
                congratulate" him on his union with his lover. Instead, the above lines reveal the speaker's 
                subordination of natural processes to his own emotional experience and his rejection of 
                nature's self-sufficiency as a standard for behavior&#8212;conceptions that correspond with 
                the speaker's attitudes toward natural phenomena in Poems I and II. In supplanting the 
                above lines with the paste-over revision, Whitman substantially altered the speaker's conception 
                of nature from one of aloofness to sympathetic endorsement, but his act of doing so had no 
                bearing on the form and meaning of "Live Oak, with Moss." By the time he replaced the 
                speaker's subordinating address to nature in Poem III with the radically different version, 
                Whitman had ceased thinking of the poem as the third section of an intact sequence that 
                continued motifs present in Poems I and II. The notebook was disassembled, and he had begun 
                to conceive of the "Live Oak" poems as parts of a different work with a different artistic plan.</p>
            <p>To be sure, critics of the versions of "Live Oak, with Moss" currently in print have had 
                no difficulty attributing significance to this and other post-dismantlement revisions in 
                their efforts to interpret the sequence. But however relevant their pronouncements 
                may be to the revised forms of the poems as Whitman published them in "Calamus," they are not 
                applicable to "Live Oak, with Moss." In particular, critics interpreting the sequence have 
                commonly read Poem II's reference to "manly love" and Poem III's congratulatory approval as 
                natural affirmations of same-sex love that counter a socially imposed hetero-normative standard 
                against which the speaker is said to struggle in the sequence. These judgments inform Helms's 
                strident verdict that "homophobia wins the determining agon of 'Live Oak'" (190) and Erkkila's 
                foreboding sense of "something that threatens and disturbs" in the imagery of Whitman's 
                paste-over revision to Poem III (105). Erkkila's reading of nature in the post-dismantlement 
                version is representative: "Far from being shocked by this scene of two men sleeping together 
                as a crime against nature, the rhythmic flow of nature appears to be at one with their erotic 
                union, as the sea congratulates the poet on his love choice" (106).<ptr target="#note22" xml:id="nr22" n="22"/> 
                But along with discrediting such interpretations of nature in "Live Oak, with Moss," the restoration 
                to Poem III should prompt us to reconsider the heavy emphasis critics have placed on the forces 
                of social proscription in the sequence.</p>
            <p>The emotional progress of the sequence&#8212;from anticipation to fulfillment, from parting to 
                rupture, and from heartache to resolve&#8212;overwhelmingly concerns the speaker's dissatisfaction 
                with solitude rather than a conflict with social norms.<ptr target="#note23" xml:id="nr23" n="23"/> 
                Whereas some passages in the sequence may suggest the anxiety and secrecy of social marginalization, 
                the consistent attitude toward nature in the opening three poems reveals the speaker's primary conflict 
                is not with an oppressive society but with a constraining intellectual and philosophical tradition, 
                namely the well-known nineteenth-century association of spiritual transcendence with isolated natural 
                experience. When considered in that context, the thematic trajectory of "Live Oak" Poems I, II, and III provides unique 
                insight on Whitman's increasing commitment to the transcendent value of love and comradeship in 
                the years following the first two editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, for nowhere 
                else in Whitman's writings do we find the quintessentially romantic coordination of solitude and 
                nature negated with such sustained and controlled deliberateness as this. In the 1855 and 1856 
                editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, the equation from English and American literary 
                sources (with origins in German philosophy) is apparent in Whitman's opening self-portrayal, 
                "I lean and loafe at my ease . . . . observing a spear of summer grass."<ptr target="#note24" xml:id="nr24" n="24"/> 
                Although Whitman had there gone on to present a broadened version of transcendent experience encompassing 
                sympathetic interaction among fellow human beings, nowhere in <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi> did he come 
                close to denying the compatibility of the natural world with individual experience. But in "Live Oak, 
                with Moss," the poet's highly controlled subordination of natural phenomena to the bliss of human 
                affections and his outright rejection of the tree's solitary joy mark a pointed moment in transatlantic 
                and native literary influence. The sequence reveals Whitman's extraordinary refutation of the transcendental pose 
                informing many important contemporaneous works, from William Wordsworth's assertion of "the bliss of 
                solitude" in "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" (1807) to Ralph Waldo Emerson's account of isolated interfusion 
                as a "transparent eyeball" in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> (1836).<ptr target="#note25" xml:id="nr25" n="25"/></p>
            <p> The subordinating rhetoric of Poem I suggests a break in particular with transcendentalist notions of mutual
                attunement between the self and nature, as illustrated by Emerson's assertion in "The American Scholar" that 
                "nature is the opposite of the soul, answering to it part for part" (55). The poem's repeated denial of nature's 
                correspondence with the soul and its gravitation instead toward love and friendship illustrate an alternative 
                ethos of sympathetic exchange among men. The attitude towards nature is present in an entry Whitman inscribed in 
                another notebook kept by him in the 1850s:<q rend="block">The air which furnishes me the breath to speak is subtle 
                and boundless&#8212;but what is it compared to the things it serves me to speak&#8212;the meanings&#8212;.<ptr target="#note26" xml:id="nr26" n="26"/></q> 
                While Emerson would not have disputed Whitman's emphasis on the expressive role of the poet in this passage, its 
                open-ended query indicates the same divergence in Whitman's debt to transcendentalism that we see in Poem I, where 
                the speaker's capacities to express and receive love distinguish him from the rest of creation.<ptr target="#note27" xml:id="nr27" n="27"/>
                Perhaps this position of philosophical dissent explains the "curious" quality of the title image in Poem II, where 
                its incongruousness may derive from what the speaker there terms its superfluity as a memento of friendship. Owing 
                to the tree's self-sufficiency, the token is in its own right unsuitable as a symbol of camaraderie. The image 
                acquires meaning only through the poet's imaginative appropriation of material phenomena for the purpose of humanistic 
                expression, an act not to be fulfilled until the speaker bonds with a fellow human being. Thus construed, the 
                ambiguity associated with the live oak twig and moss in Poem II becomes resolved at the end of the sequence with the 
                speaker's determination to "engraft" his knowledge of love and heartache on one who is predisposed to receive his message.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the mutual attunement attributed to the soul and nature by Emerson, Whitman uses parallel rhetoric 
                at many points of the sequence to illustrate the speaker's desire for balanced reciprocity between himself and other 
                men, e.g. "This moment as I sit alone, yearning and pensive, it seems to me there are other men, in other lands, 
                yearning and pensive" (4.1), and "I am to go with him I love, and he is to go with me" (5.12). Among additional 
                examples in the sequence, an especially meaningful instance derives from the heartache of Poem VIII ("Hours 
                continuing long") when the speaker endeavors to visualize another man capable of identifying with his pain: "Does he see 
                himself reflected in me? In these hours does he see the face of his hours reflected?" (8.12). The sole exception 
                occurs in Poem XI ("Earth! My Likeness!"), where the speaker confesses without qualification that the earth's 
                volcanic forces correspond with "something fierce and terrible" in himself (11.3). But here the reversal is 
                in keeping with the work's elevation of human interaction over natural isolation, for in Poem XI the 
                exception occurs within a context of emotional insecurity prompted by the speaker's fears that his affection 
                may be unreturned.<ptr target="#note28" xml:id="nr28" n="28"/> Coming after the episode of rupture and heartache 
                in the sequence, its subject matter contrasts starkly with the ebullience of desire and anticipation depicted in 
                Poem I.</p>
            <p>With his breaking up of the sequence, Whitman abandoned its dissenting stance on nature, as revealed by 
                his post-dismantlement portrayal of a natural world that endorses human love and affection in Poem III. 
                In a similar reversal, Whitman's revision of Poem II abruptly identifies the "live oak" image with "manly 
                love," diminishing substantially the alluring ambiguity it had lent to the sequence in its notebook state 
                and replacing that tension with an internal contradiction: the speaker's direct association of a fraternal 
                principle with the tree whose solitude he has just rejected. Odd as it sounds in light of the status "I saw 
                in Louisiana a live-oak growing" now holds among Whitman's writings, the effect of the revision may well have 
                been more inadvertent than meaningful, prompted more by his need to eliminate its reference to the abandoned 
                sequence than by any artistic impulse to develop its content. Although Poem I was transferred to "Calamus" 
                without similar revisions, none of the new poems composed by Whitman for the larger cluster displays its 
                dissent from the romantic ideal of mutual attunement with nature.</p>
            <p>After dismantlement Whitman likewise abandoned the linear coherence by which Bowers first recognized 
                "Live Oak, with Moss" as an integrated story of crisis and reconstitution. Exact details of how the 
                alteration in plans occurred are beyond knowing. But Whitman's changing succession of titles for the 
                post-dismantlement cluster sheds some light on its evolution. At some point after he disassembled the 
                notebook, but apparently before substituting the title "Calamus-Leaves" for "Live Oak, with Moss" at 
                the head of Poem I, Whitman recorded the following idea for what would become "Enfans d'Adam" in the 
                1860 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> ("Children of Adam" in later editions):
                <q rend="block">A string of Poems, (short, &amp;c.) embodying the amative love of woman&#8212;the same 
                as Live Oak Leaves do the passion of friendship for man.<ptr target="#note29" xml:id="nr29" n="29"/></q>
                The emergence of "Live Oak Leaves" as title for a work embodying the passion of male
                friendship would appear to have derived from Whitman's alternate groupings and combination of
                "Live Oak" poems with additional poems after dismantlement of the notebook. This
                reordering and expansion of the 12-poem cluster involved a corresponding alteration
                in the rhetorical character of the cluster, for the now-pluralized title "Live Oak Leaves" 
                suggests Whitman likewise abandoned the linear narrative approach that had characterized the
                poems in their notebook order. With other poems in preparation for the next edition of 
                <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, Whitman was already experimenting with titles 
                such as "Buds," "Droppings," and "Leaves" to label composite groupings of poems loosely 
                connected by shared subjects. Rather than connoting the linear narrative of his original 
                sequence, the loose plurality implied by the title "Live Oak Leaves" suggests instead the 
                nonlinear deployment of leitmotifs implied by the names of these groupings. The early title 
                "Live Oak Leaves" forecasts Whitman's increasing adoption of this approach with the still-greater 
                expansion of poems identified by his next intervening title, "Calamus-Leaves"&#8212;an 
                approach fully displayed in the published "Calamus" cluster.</p></div>

            <p>Whitman abandoned his original intention to privately commemorate "the thoughts, 
                pictures&#8212;aspirations, &amp;c. Fit to be perused during the days of the approach 
                of Death." But the product of that intention can be studied in the form of the following 
                digital edition, one that observes and rejects Whitman's changes to the manuscript 
                in accordance with the classifications described above. The restorative edition thus
                observes class 1 and 2 revisions, as well as Whitman's ambiguous class 4 changes. It rejects 
                Whitman's post-dismantlement class 3 revisions and pencil revisions. Whitman's non-standard 
                spellings such as "prest" for "pressed" (6.5) are preserved, as is the period spelling "develope" 
                (12.1), which he altered in pencil. All changes to the manuscript are described in the accompanying 
                notes&#8212;where appropriate with reference to Bowers's versions of the texts in <hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> 
                (cited in note 3). Presented as an electronically encoded reading text, the restorative edition 
                supplies markup for class 4 revisions to observe their contingent character. Whitman's line breaks 
                are observed to facilitate comparison of the reading text with the accompanying images. With the 
                sole exception of the hyphenated expression, "perfect-model'd," in textual lines 11 and 12 of original 
                notebook leaf 10 (verse line 2 of Poem VI), Whitman's line-end hyphenations consist of single-word 
                compounds that should be represented as unhyphenated words in quotations or transcriptions 
                based on the restorative edition. Double hyphens used for line-end, single-word, and 
                double-word hyphenation are represented as single hyphens. According to Bowers, a former owner of 
                Whitman's manuscripts for the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi>, Barnet J. Beyer, is likely the 
                source of pencil annotations at the heads of the leaves identifying them with their "Calamus" 
                numberings (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> xxiii).</p>

            <p>This electronic edition is dedicated to Hershel Parker, who brought Whitman's "Live Oak,

                4th ed. (1994). The Introduction has benefited from feedback by Matt Cohen and from the anonymous

                with late additions to the table encoding. Jeremy Jensen provided essential technical support for my 
                creation of the edition file, and Shawna Hanel supplied advice and help with imaging. I am also 
                grateful to the staff of University of Virginia's Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections 
                Library for access to Whitman's manuscripts, and to the University of Virginia Library administration

                    her transcription of poems 3 through 9.</note>
                <note xml:id="note15"> Other possibilities are difficult to credit. According to Bowers 
                    (who misread a fiber in the paper as a comma after "finished"), "one can only speculate 
                    whether the application is to this poem [Poem VIII], or else was a note added after 
                    the inscription of no. VII" (<hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> 82). But 
                    the ink inscription of Poem VIII reveals no sign of abrasion that would normally 
                    result from the act of erasure, nor is it likely that Whitman would have recorded 
                    the pencil note directly onto the fair copy text of Poem VIII. If he had wished 
                    to append such a comment to Poem VIII, there was sufficient blank space beside the 
                    Roman numeral heading immediately above the first line of the poem.</note>
                <note xml:id="note16"> Whitman's notebook ordering of "Live Oak, with Moss" appears 
                    to have been the culmination of previous trial arrangements. In addition to the 
                    draft fragment of Poem II that displays on its verso Whitman's note about a cluster 
                    of poems "fit to be perused in the days of the approach of death," canceled draft 
                    fragments also exist for what would become "Live Oak" Poems III ("When I heard at 
                    the close of day"), VIII ("Hours continuing long"), and XI ("Earth! My likeness!"). 
                    In these canceled draft states, Poems III and XI are numbered IV and VI, indicating 
                    Whitman completed an earlier arrangement of at least six of the twelve poems before 
                    inscribing them in the notebook version of "Live Oak, with Moss." The drafts exist 
                    on the versos of un-canceled mss: see <hi rend="italic">Whitman Archive</hi>

                    <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1a leaf 2 may indicate that Whitman first removed the 
                    blank outer conjugate notebook leaves 1 and 22 and attempted to preserve the remaining 
                    leaves intact with a more visually distinctive cover.</note>
                <note xml:id="note19"> Both revisions produced wet ink that transferred to the preceding verso 
                    when Whitman closed the notebook after making the changes. In his revision to Poem II 
                    the diagonal down-stroke of the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in "life" offset to the recto 
                    of leaf 2. The offset matches with the original pen stroke when the notebook hinge points 
                    of the separated leaves are aligned, and they do not match when the connective pinholes 
                    of leaves 1 and 2 are aligned, showing that the revision was made when the notebook was 
                    still intact. Whitman over-wrote the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> with a <hi rend="italic">v</hi> 
                    in the same ink, likely before going on to inscribe the terminal <hi rend="italic">e</hi>. 
                    In the same manner, the exclamation point added by Whitman to line 1 of Poem VII offset to 
                    the preceding verso of leaf 10 of the intact notebook.</note>

                <note xml:id="note21"> The question naturally arises whether or not the white wove 
                    paste-over patch derives from one of the two unlocated notebook leaves. 
                    As observed above, vestiges of brown ink letter forms at the severed edges of 
                    paste-over revisions to "Calamus" 37 and "So Long!" reveal that 
                    <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1a notebook leaf 1 (of which these two 
                    paste-over leaves were originally its conjugate half) was used for some other 
                    purpose of inscription, and so leaf 1 can be ruled out on that basis. No such 
                    vestiges remain of the missing <hi rend="small-caps">w</hi>1b notebook leaf 21, 
                    but it too can be ruled out on the basis of material evidence. The bottom edge of 
                    the leaf 6 paste-over is a straight factory cut resembling the clean bottom edges 
                    of all the leaves from which Whitman assembled his notebook, the other three edges 
                    of which were unevenly cut. If the leaf 6 paste-over derived from the missing leaf 
                    21, it would therefore have to be from the lower portion of the leaf that preserved the
                    straight factory edge. But a machine-direction line running immediately parallel
                    to the bottom edge of notebook leaf 2 (leaf 21's conjugate half) is not to be
                    found on the leaf 6 paste-over, revealing that the patch derives from some other
                    sheet of white wove paper and never constituted a portion of the notebook.</note>
                <note xml:id="note22"> See also Richard Tayson, who emphasizes "that the natural world 
                    approves of Whitman's homosexual union with his friend, his lover, and of their 
                    'manly love'" in "The Casualties of Walt Whitman," <hi rend="italic">Virginia 
                    Quarterly Review</hi> 81 (Spring 2005): 79-95. While observing the paste-over revision 
                    to Poem III in their editions of "Live Oak, with Moss" (see note 1), Fone and Erkkila 
                    each reprint Bowers's transcription of Whitman's original conclusion in a footnote, 
                    with both duplicating Bowers's erroneous reading of "is" for "was" in "he I love was 
                    returned and sleeping by my side" (see Bowers, <hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts</hi> 
                    88).</note>
                <note xml:id="note23"> The attribution of linear coherence is contested by Erkkila, who 
                    asserts of Poems I through III that "there is no logical narrative progression in 
                    these three poems" and argues that the sequence as a whole should be construed as 
                    moving "paratactically, by juxtaposition and association rather than by any clear, 
                    logical, or linear development" (106). But there is no need to accept this choice 
                    between mutually exclusive narrative and montage. Whitman indeed violates strict 
                    linear development from poem to poem in the sequence by alternating between 
                    recollection and meditation, and by sometimes communicating the speaker's thoughts 
                    and experiences by proxy in his depictions of other men. But these rhetorical 
                    innovations augment rather than diminish the significance of the narrative account, 
                    much as similarly multivalent rhetorical applications augment Whitman's account of 
                    a life journey in "Song of Myself" and the poet's progress from mourning to recovery 
                    in "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd." In "Live Oak, with Moss," Whitman's 
                    rhetorical freedoms play out within a logically ordered sequence of emotional 
                    experiences and attitudes that make up the narrative account of love, heartache, 
                    and reconstitution.</note>
