				Title: Live Oak, with Moss.] Struck out by a single horizontal line, with
				the title "Calamus-Leaves" and a period inscribed above&#8212;all in light brown ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note2">
				1.5: something] A horizontal blue pencil line has been supplied under an
				end-line double hyphen following "some."  If intended for hyphenation, as 
				Bowers seems to assert ("the hyphen has been mended in blue pencil"), 
				the blue line is superfluous because the double hyphen is clearly legible; 
				see <hi rend="italic">Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass (1860) A 
				Parallel Text</hi> (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press), 
					92 (hereafter cited parenthetically).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note3">
				1.5: to] The "t" is superimposed over a smudged letter or letters, possibly "th."
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note4">
				2: II.] The period is omitted by Whitman, and is supplied here following the precedent 
				established in his heading to Poem I and observed by him in headings IV through 
				IX and XI.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note5">
				2.3: with] Crossed out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note6">
				2.7: lately] Interlined with a caret in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note7">
				2.8: I write . . . after it] Struck out by horizontal lines, with "&#8212;it makes me think of 
				manly love." interlined above&#8212;all in light brown ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note8">
				2.9: live oak] Interlined with a caret above "tree," which is struck out by a 
				diagonal slash; unnoted by Bowers (102), in "live" Whitman initially inscribed an <hi rend="italic">f</hi> 
				and subsequently over-wrote it with a <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, probably before going on to
				inscribe the terminal <hi rend="italic">e</hi>&#8212;all in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note9">
				3: III.] The period is omitted by Whitman, and is supplied here following the precedent 
				established in his heading to Poem I and observed by him in headings IV through IX and XI.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note10">
				3.1: followed] The ending "ed" is superimposed over "d" in the same ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note11">
				3.2: And else,] Crossed out, with "Nor" substituted above&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note12">
				3.2: Or] Crossed out at the line ending, with a dash interlined above, and "&#8212;Nor" interlined 
				with a caret at the start of the next line before "when"&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note13">
				3.2: my plans] The word "favorite" is interlined with a caret in pencil between "my" and "plans".
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note14">
				3.2: it was well enough] Crossed out, with "was I really happy," interlined above&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note15">
				3.2: Still I was not happy] Crossed out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note16">
				3.3: the] Interlined above "that," which is struck out by a diagonal slash&#8212;all in black ink. 
				The substitution of "the" was subsequently amended in pencil to "that". This was later 
				entirely crossed out in pencil, again with the substitution of "the" in pencil, which was 
				later struck out yet again, with "that" restored in pencil. The original black ink substitution 
				is observed here.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note17">
				3.3: when] Crossed out in pencil, with another "when" later interlined and then crossed out in pencil. 
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note18">
				3.6: then I] The upper-case letter "O" is interlined with a caret (both in pencil) between "then" and "I".
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note19">
				3.7: O then each] "O" crossed out, with "then" emended to "Then"&#8212;all in pencil. Later, "Then" was 
				crossed out, with "each" emended to "Each"&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note20">
				3.8: next,] Bowers identifies the comma as accidentally smudged by Whitman in the process of erasing 
				"some illegible word" beneath it (88), but no such erasure is evident. The comma is instead largely 
				obscured by a layer of paste transferred in the process of Whitman's paste-over revision of 
				lines 24-26, and Bowers seems to have mistaken contours in the dried paste (likely applied by 
				Whitman's thumb print or finger print) for an erased word.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note21">
				3.9: was] Bowers erroneously reads "is" (88).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note22">
				3.9-11: And that night . . . I was happy] Canceled by a paste-over leaf, on which the following four 
				lines are substituted in a black ink ({i} signifies an insertion in the same ink):
				<l>And that night, while all<lb/>
				was still, I heard the<lb/>
				waters roll slowly continually<lb/>
				up the shores</l>
				<l>I heard the hissing rustle of<lb/>
				the liqu{i}d and sands, as directed<lb/>
				to me, whispering to congratulate<lb/>
				me,&#8212;For the friend I love lay<lb/>
				sleeping by my side,</l>
				<l>In the stillness his face was 
					<choice>
						<orig>in-<lb/>clined</orig>
						<reg>inclined</reg>
					</choice> towards me, while the<lb/>
				moon's clear beams shone,</l>
				<l>And his arm lay lightly over my<lb/>
				breast&#8212;And that night I was happy.</l>
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note23">
				4.2: It] As Bowers observes, "Whitman began the line with 'I,' and then emended it to a t, prefixing 
				capital I," in effect beginning the line anew at a point closer to the right edge of the leaf, and 
				at a position more closely aligned with the starting point of line 27 directly above (106).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note24">
				4.2: China, or in] The word "India" and a comma are interlined with a caret between "China," and "or"; 
				the word "in" (immediately preceding "Russia") is crossed out&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note25">
				4.2: dialects,] The comma is faint here not from erasure but apparently a flaw at the point of Whitman's 
				pen, as further indicated by similar imperfections in the script from here to the end of the leaf. That 
				Whitman paused in transcription to replace or repair his implement is indicated by the absence of 
				such flaws on the following leaf 8, which contains the first 5 lines of Poem V.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note26">
				4.3: better] Crossed out, with a comma interlined after "men" but later crossed out&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note27">
				4.5: know . . . know] Both instances of "know" are crossed out, with "think" interlined above at both 
				points&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note28">
				5.2: my lands] Struck out by a single line, with "the Land of the Prairies" interlined above&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note29">
				5.2: me&#8212;] Interlined above "me" in pencil is the clause "&#8212;the south Savannahs engrossed me&#8212;".
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note30">
				5.3: I heard the examples] The clause, "the examples" is struck out by diagonal slashes in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note31">
				5.6: Lake] Originally inscribed with a lower case "l," but emended to upper case in the same ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note32">
				5.8: I have passed ahead&#8212;] Crossed out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note33">
				6.4: two men] The word, "young" is struck out by diagonal slashes in between "two" and "men" in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note34">
				6.5: to remain] Interlined above "who remained," which is struck out by diagonal slashes&#8212;all in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note35">
				6.5: to depart] Interlined above "who departed," which is struck out by a horizontal line&#8212;all in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note36">
				6.5: to remain] Interlined above "who remained," which is struck out by a horizontal line&#8212;all in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note37">
				7.1: !] Added above a comma, which is struck out by diagonal slashes&#8212;all in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note38">
				7.8: and] The "a" overwrites an illegible letter in the same ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note39">
				7.10: through fields,] Interlined with a caret in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note40">
				7.10: woods, on] Preceding "on" is the word "or", crossed out in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note41">
				8: VIII.] Supplied in black ink above canceled "IX." The poem overwrites an erased pencil inscription, 
				"finished in the other city" within enlarged parentheses.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note42">
				8.2: dusk] It is not clear whether the "k" is "heavily mended," as Bowers asserts (83), or inadvertently smudged.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note43">
				8.2: seating] As Bowers observes, the "ing" overwrites a smudge that may have been an "ed" that was effaced 
				while the ink was still wet (82).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note44">
				8.4: him content] The "c" overwrites an aborted pen stroke in the same ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note45">
				8.5: forgotten] The "en" overwrites unidentified letters in the same ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note46">
				8.7: my] Omitted by Bowers (84).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note47">
				8.8: me] Bowers asserts "me" to be "written over a smudge, probably representing an erasure" (84). As with "lost to" 
				directly below, the "smudge" is in fact dried glue transferred from the point where original notebook leaf 
				14 and the top portion of 15 were joined (between lines 69 and 70 above). The displaced glue was wiped by 
				Whitman using a thumb or finger, the print of which is discernable at the spot.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note48">
				8.9: lost to] Bowers asserts "lost to him?" to be "written over a smudged erasure" (84). As with "me" directly above, 
				the "smudged erasure" is in fact dried glue transferred from the point where original notebook leaf 14 and 
				the top portion of 15 were joined (between lines 69 and 70 above). The displaced glue was wiped by Whitman 
				using a thumb or finger, the print of which is discernable at the spot. An identical situation appears at 
				the end of the line with "lost?", unnoted by Bowers.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note49">
				9.3: the quality of] Crossed out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note50">
				10: X.] The period is omitted by Whitman, and is supplied here following the precedent established in his heading 
				to Poem I and observed by him in headings IV through IX and XI.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note51">
				10.1: often and] Interlined with a caret in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note52">
				10.1: where you] Preceding "you" is the word "I", struck out by diagonal slashes in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note53">
				11.1: My likeness!] Struck out by diagonal slashes in black ink. The "n" in "likeness" is smeared but not verifiably 
				"mended over some smudged-out letter," as Bowers asserts (114).
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note54">
				11.1: spheric there] Unnoted by Bowers (114), the line originally ended with a period at "spheric," presumably in error. 
				Whitman added "there" followed by a comma or (less likely) a semi-colon, which he wiped out while the ink was still wet. 
				He neglected to cancel the period following "spheric," which is omitted here.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note55">
				11.3: For] The "o" in "For" is smeared and perhaps written over an "a", as reported by Bowers (114). Also noted by Bowers, in the same ink Whitman used a caret to insert an em dash before "and" at the start of the next textual line (114). The revision observes faithfully Whitman's canceled draft version of this poem, where the opening em dash was retained when Whitman interlined "and I him&#8212;but" (see <hi rend="italic">Whitman Archive</hi> loc.0025.001 &lt;<ref type="url" target="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/figures/loc.00225.001.jpg">http://www.whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/figures/loc.00225.001.jpg</ref>&gt;.</note>
				<note xml:id="note56">
				12: XII.] The period is omitted by Whitman, and is supplied here following the precedent established in his heading 
				to Poem I and observed by him in headings IV through IX and XI.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note57">
				12.1: develope] Terminal "e" struck out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note58">
				12.2: rolls] Crossed out, with the word "speed" interlined above&#8212;all in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note59">
				12.2: the blood] Preceding "blood" is the word "red," struck out by diagonal slashes in black ink.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note60">
				12.2: divine] Crossed out in pencil.
				</note>
				<note xml:id="note61">
				12.2: mine?] The lower portion of the question mark is smudged, but not verifiably inserted or emended, as suggested 
				by Bowers (119).
