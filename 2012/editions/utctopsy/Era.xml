   <p n="1"><s n="1">One morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy<lb/>
in some of her domestic cares, St. Clare&#x2019;s voice<lb/>

to show you.&#8221;</s></p>

down with her sewing in her hand.</s></p>
<p n="4"><s n="4">&#8220;I&#x2019;ve made a purchase for your department;<lb/>
see here,&#8221; said St. Clare; and, with the word,<lb/>
he pulled along a little negro girl, about eight<lb/>
or nine years of age.</s></p>
<p n="5"><s n="5">She was one of the blackest of her race, and<lb/>
her round, shining eyes, glittering as glass<lb/>
beads, moved with quick and restless glances<lb/>
over everything in the room.</s> <s n="6">Her mouth, half<lb/>
open with astonishment at the wonders of the<lb/>
new mass&#x2019;r&#x2019;s parlor, displayed a white and<lb/>
brilliant set of teeth.</s> <s n="7">Her woolly hair was<lb/>
braided in sundry little tails, which stuck out<lb/>
in every direction.</s> <s n="8">The expression of her face<lb/>
was an odd mixture of shrewdness and <choice><orig>cun-<lb/>ning,</orig>
 <reg>cunning,<lb/></reg></choice> over which was oddly drawn, like a kind<lb/>
of veil, an expression of the most doleful <choice><orig>gravi-<lb/>ty</orig>
 <reg>gravity<lb/></reg></choice> and solemnity.</s> <s n="9">She was dressed in a single<lb/>
&#64257;lthy, ragged garment, made of bagging, and<lb/>
stood with her hands demurely folded before<lb/>
her.</s> <s n="10">Altogether, there was something odd<lb/>

 <reg>appearance&#8212;something,<lb/></reg></choice> as Miss Ophelia afterwards said, &#8220;so<lb/>
heathenish,&#8221; as to inspire that good lady with<lb/>
utter dismay; and turning to St. Clare, she<lb/>
said&#8212;</s></p>

brought that thing here for?&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="7"><s n="12">&#8220;For you to educate, to be sure, and train<lb/>
in the way she should go.</s> <s n="13">I thought she was<lb/>
rather a funny specimen in the Jim Crow line.</s><lb/>
<s n="14">Here, Topsy,&#8221; he added, giving a whistle, as a<lb/>
man would, to call the attention of a dog,<lb/>
&#8220;give us a song, now, and show us some of your<lb/>
dancing.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="8"><s n="15">The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind<lb/>
of wicked drollery, and the thing struck up, in<lb/>
a clear, shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to<lb/>
which she kept time with her hands and feet,<lb/>
spinning round, clapping her hands, knocking<lb/>
her knees together, in a wild, fantastic sort of<lb/>
time, and producing in her throat all those odd<lb/>
guttural sounds which distinguish the native<lb/>
music of her race; and &#64257;nally, turning a <choice><orig>sum-<lb/>merset</orig>
 <reg>summerset<lb/></reg></choice> or two, and giving a prolonged closing<lb/>
note, as odd and unearthly as that of a steam<lb/>
whistle, she came suddenly down on the carpet,<lb/>
and stood with her hands folded, and a most<lb/>
sanctimonious expression of meekness and <choice><orig>so-<lb/>lemnity</orig>
 <reg>solemnity<lb/></reg></choice> over her face, only broken by the <choice><orig>cun-<lb/>ning</orig>
 <reg>cunning<lb/></reg></choice> glances which she shot askance from the<lb/>
corners of her eyes.</s></p>
<p n="9"><s n="16">Miss Ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed<lb/>
with amazement.</s></p>

spoke.</s></p>

for?&#8221; said Miss Ophelia.</s> <s n="24">&#8220;Your house is so full<lb/>

up in the <ref target="UTC20.S025a">morning, and I &#64257;nd one</ref> asleep behind<lb/>
the door, and see one black head poking out<lb/>
from under the table, one lying on the door mat,<lb/>
and they are mopping and <ref target="UTC20.S025a1">moving</ref> and grinning<lb/>
between all the railings, and tumbling over the<lb/>
kitchen &#64258;oor.</s> <s n="26">What on earth did you want<lb/>

I would make you a present of a fresh-caught<lb/>

<s n="32">But let me see one of you that would take one<lb/>
into your house with you, and take the labor of<lb/>
their conversion on yourselves.</s> <s n="33">No; when it<lb/>
comes to that, they are dirty and disagreeable,<lb/>
and it&#x2019;s too much care, and so on.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="19"><s n="34">&#8220;Augustine, you know I didn&#x2019;t think of it in<lb/>
that light,&#8221; said Miss Ophelia, evidently <choice><orig>soften-<lb/>ing.</orig>
 <reg>softening.<lb/></reg></choice></s> <s n="35">&#8220;Well, it might be a real missionary<lb/>

<p n="20"><s n="36">St. Clare had touched the right string.</s> <s n="37">Miss<lb/>

 <reg>after<lb/></reg></choice> all, that there&#x2019;s no sense in them.</s> <s n="41">Why, the<lb/>

<p n="22"><s n="45">&#8220;Well, I&#x2019;ll do what I can,&#8221; said Miss Ophelia;<lb/>

went through all the disgusting details with<lb/>
heroic thoroughness, though, it must be <choice><orig>con-<lb/>fessed,</orig>
 <reg>confessed,<lb/></reg></choice> with no very gracious air; for endurance<lb/>
