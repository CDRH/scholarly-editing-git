to show you.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="3"><s n="3">&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Miss Ophelia, coming<lb/>
down, with her sewing in her hand.</s></p>
<p n="4"><s n="4">&#8220;I&#x2019;ve made a purchase for your department,&#8212;see here,&#8221;<lb/>
said St. Clare; and, with the word, he pulled along a little<lb/>
negro girl, about eight or nine years of age.</s></p>
<p n="5"><s n="5">She was one of the blackest of her race; and her round,<lb/>
shining eyes, glittering as glass beads, moved with quick and<lb/>
restless glances over every thing in the room.</s> <s n="6">Her mouth,<lb/>

parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth.</s> <s n="7">Her<lb/>
woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which stuck out<lb/>
in every direction.</s> <s n="8">The expression of her face was an odd<lb/>
mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly<lb/>
drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful<lb/>
gravity and solemnity.</s> <s n="9">She was dressed in a single &#64257;lthy,<lb/>
ragged garment, made of bagging; and stood with her hands<lb/>
demurely folded before her.</s> <s n="10">Altogether, there was something<lb/>
odd and goblin-like about her appearance,&#8212;something, as<lb/>
Miss Ophelia afterwards said, &#8220;so heathenish,&#8221; as to inspire<lb/>
that good lady with utter dismay; and, turning to St. Clare,<lb/>
she said,&#8212;</s></p>

here for?&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="7"><s n="12">&#8220;For you to educate, to be sure, and train in the way she<lb/>
should go.</s> <s n="13">I thought she was rather a funny specimen in the<lb/>
Jim Crow line.</s> <s n="14">Here, Topsy,&#8221; he added, giving a whistle, as<lb/>
a man would to call the attention of a dog, &#8220;give us a song,<lb/>
now, and show us some of your dancing.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="8"><s n="15">The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked <choice><orig>droll-<lb/>ery,</orig>
 <reg>drollery,<lb/></reg></choice> and the thing struck up, in a clear, shrill voice, an odd<lb/>
negro melody, to which she kept time with her hands and feet,<lb/>
spinning round, clapping her hands, knocking her knees <choice><orig>to-<lb/>gether,</orig>
 <reg>together,<lb/></reg></choice> in a wild, fantastic sort of time, and producing in her<lb/>
throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the<lb/>
native music of her race; and &#64257;nally, turning a somerset or<lb/>
two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and unearthly<lb/>
as that of a steam whistle, she came suddenly down on the<lb/>
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most <choice><orig>sanctimo-<lb/>nious</orig>
 <reg>sanctimonious<lb/></reg></choice> expression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only<lb/>
broken by the cunning glances which she shot askance from<lb/>
the corners of her eyes.</s></p>

 <reg>amazement.</reg></choice></s></p>
<p n="10"><s n="17">St. Clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to<lb/>

Ophelia.</s> <s n="24">&#8220;Your house is so full of these little plagues, now,<lb/>

get up in the <ref target="UTC20.S025a">morning, and &#64257;nd one</ref> asleep behind the door, and<lb/>
see one black head poking out from under the table, one lying<lb/>

<p n="16"><s n="27">&#8220;For you to educate&#8212;didn&#x2019;t I tell you?</s> <s n="28">You&#x2019;re always<lb/>
preaching about educating.</s> <s n="29">I thought I would make you a<lb/>
present of a fresh-caught specimen, and let you try your hand<lb/>
on her, and bring her up in the way she should go.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="17"><s n="30">&#8220;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don&#x2019;t want her, I am sure;&#8212;I have more to do with &#x2019;em<lb/>

and get some poor missionary to spend all his days among just<lb/>
such heathen.</s> <s n="32">But let me see one of you that would take one<lb/>
into your house with you, and take the labor of their <choice><orig>conver-<lb/>sion</orig>
 <reg>conversion<lb/></reg></choice> on yourselves!</s> <s n="33">No; when it comes to that, they are dirty<lb/>
and disagreeable, and it&#x2019;s too much care, and so on.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="19"><s n="34">&#8220;Augustine, you know I didn&#x2019;t think of it in that light,&#8221;<lb/>
said Miss Ophelia, evidently softening.</s> <s n="35">&#8220;Well, it might be a<lb/>
real missionary work,&#8221; said she, looking rather more favorably<lb/>
on the child.</s></p>
<p n="20"><s n="36">St. Clare had touched the right string.</s> <s n="37">Miss Ophelia&#x2019;s <choice><orig>con-<lb/>scientiousness</orig>
 <reg>conscientiousness<lb/></reg></choice> was ever on the alert.</s> <s n="38">&#8220;But,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I<lb/>
really didn&#x2019;t see the need of buying this one;&#8212;there are<lb/>

<p n="21"><s n="39">&#8220;Well, then, <ref target="UTC20.S039a">cousin,&#8221;</ref> said St. Clare, drawing her aside, &#8220;I<lb/>

<s n="40">You are so good, after all, that there&#x2019;s no sense in them.</s><lb/>
<s n="41">Why, the fact is, this concern belonged to a couple of drunken<lb/>
creatures that keep a low restaurant that I have to pass by<lb/>

 <pb facs="JIL_pg_0302" n="302"/>
every day, and I was tired of hearing her screaming, and them<lb/>
beating and swearing at her.</s> <s n="42">She looked bright and funny,<lb/>
too, as if something might be made of her;&#8212;so I bought her,<lb/>
and I&#x2019;ll give her to you.</s> <s n="43">Try, now, and give her a good <choice><orig>ortho-<lb/>dox</orig>

her.</s> <s n="44">You know I haven&#x2019;t any gift that way; but I&#x2019;d like<lb/>
you to try.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="22"><s n="45">&#8220;Well, I&#x2019;ll do what I can,&#8221; said Miss Ophelia; and she <choice><orig>ap-<lb/>proached</orig>
 <reg>approached<lb/></reg></choice> her new subject very much as a person might be <choice><orig>sup-<lb/>posed</orig>
 <reg>supposed<lb/></reg></choice> to approach a black spider, supposing them to have<lb/>
benevolent designs towards it.</s></p>
<p n="23"><s n="46">&#8220;She&#x2019;s dreadfully dirty, and half naked,&#8221; she said.</s></p>
<p n="24"><s n="47">&#8220;Well, take her down stairs, and make some of them clean<lb/>
and clothe her up.&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="25"><s n="48">Miss Ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions.</s></p>
<p n="26"><s n="49">&#8220;Don&#x2019;t see what <ref target="UTC20.S049a">Mas&#x2019;r</ref> St. Clare wants of &#x2019;nother nigger!&#8221;<lb/>
said Dinah, surveying the new arrival with no friendly air.</s><lb/>

<p n="27"><s n="51">&#8220;Pah!&#8221; said Rosa and Jane, with supreme disgust; &#8220;let her<lb/>
keep out of our way!</s> <s n="52">What in the world <ref target="UTC20.S051a">mas&#x2019;r</ref> wanted <choice><orig>an-<lb/>other</orig>
 <reg>another<lb/></reg></choice> of these low niggers for, I can&#x2019;t see!&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="28"><s n="53">&#8220;You go long!</s> <s n="54">No more nigger dan you be, Miss Rosa,&#8221;<lb/>
said Dinah, who felt this last remark a re&#64258;ection on herself.</s><lb/>

<p n="29"><s n="58">Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that<lb/>
would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the<lb/>
new arrival; and so she was forced to do it herself, with some<lb/>
very ungracious and reluctant assistance from Jane.</s></p>
<p n="30"><s n="59">It is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the &#64257;rst<lb/>
toilet of a neglected, abused child.</s> <s n="60">In fact, in this world,<lb/>
multitudes must live and die in a state that it would be too<lb/>
great a shock to the nerves of their fellow-mortals even to<lb/>
hear described.</s> <s n="61">Miss Ophelia had a good, strong, practical<lb/>
deal of resolution; and she went through all the disgusting<lb/>
details with heroic thoroughness, though, it must be confessed,<lb/>
with no very gracious air,&#8212;for endurance was the utmost to<lb/>
which her principles could bring her.</s> <s n="62">When she saw, on the<lb/>
back and shoulders of the child, great welts and calloused<lb/>

 <pb facs="JIL_pg_0303" n="303" />
spots, ine&#64256;aceable marks of the system under which she had<lb/>
grown up thus far, her heart became pitiful within her.</s></p>
<p n="31"><s n="63">&#8220;See there!&#8221; said Jane, pointing to the marks, &#8220;don&#x2019;t that<lb/>
show she&#x2019;s a limb?</s> <s n="64">We&#x2019;ll have &#64257;ne works with her, I reckon.</s><lb/>
<s n="65">I hate these nigger young uns!</s> <s n="66">so disgusting!</s> <s n="67">I wonder that<lb/>
<ref target="UTC20.S067a">mas&#x2019;r</ref> would buy her!&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="32"><s n="68">The &#8220;young un&#8221; alluded to heard all these comments with<lb/>
the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her, only<lb/>
scanning, with a keen and furtive glance of her &#64258;ickering eyes,<lb/>
the ornaments which Jane wore in her ears.</s> <s n="69">When arrayed<lb/>
at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing, her hair cropped<lb/>
short to her head, Miss Ophelia, with some satisfaction, said<lb/>
she looked more Christian-like than she did, and in her own<lb/>
mind began to mature some plans for her instruction.</s></p>
<p n="33"><s n="70">Sitting down before her, she began to question her.</s></p>
<p n="34"><s n="71">&#8220;How old are you, Topsy?&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="35"><s n="72">&#8220;Dun no, missis,&#8221; said the image, with a grin that showed<lb/>
all her teeth.</s></p>
<p n="36"><s n="73">&#8220;Don&#x2019;t know how old you are?</s> <s n="74">Didn&#x2019;t any body ever tell<lb/>
you?</s> <s n="75">Who was your mother?&#8221;</s></p>
<p n="37"><s n="76">&#8220;Never had none!&#8221; said the child, with another grin.</s></p>
<p n="38"><s n="77">&#8220;Never had any mother?</s> <s n="78">What do you mean?</s> <s n="79">Where<lb/>
were you born?&#8221;</s></p>
