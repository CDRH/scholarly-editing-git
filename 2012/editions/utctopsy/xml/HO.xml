<p n="4"><s n="4">&#8220;I&#8239;&#x2019;ve made a purchase for your department,&#8212;see here,&#8221;<lb/>
said St. Clare; and, with the word, he pulled along a little<lb/>
negro girl, about eight or nine years of age.</s></p>
<p n="5"><s n="5">She was one of the blackest of her race; and her round,<lb/>
shining eyes, glittering as glass beads, moved with quick and<lb/>
restless glances over everything in the room.</s> <s n="6">Her mouth, half<lb/>
open with astonishment at the wonders of the new Mas&#x2019;r&#x2019;s<lb/>
parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth.</s> <s n="7">Her<lb/>
woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which stuck out<lb/>
in every direction.</s> <s n="8">The expression of her face was an odd<lb/>
mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly<lb/>
drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful<lb/>
gravity and solemnity.</s> <s n="9">She was dressed in a single &#64257;lthy,<lb/>
ragged garment, made of bagging; and stood with her hands<lb/>
demurely folded before her.</s> <s n="10">Altogether, there was something<lb/>
odd and goblin-like about her appearance,&#8212;something, as<lb/>
Miss Ophelia afterwards said, &#8220;so heathenish,&#8221; as to inspire<lb/>
that good lady with utter dismay; and, turning to St. Clare,<lb/>
she said,&#8212;</s></p>

should go.</s> <s n="13">I thought she was rather a funny specimen in the<lb/>
Jim Crow line.</s> <s n="14">Here, Topsy,&#8221; he added, giving a whistle, as a<lb/>
man would to call the attention of a dog, &#8220;give us a song, now,<lb/>

 <reg>drollery,<lb/></reg></choice> and the thing struck up, in a clear shrill voice, an odd<lb/>
negro melody, to which she kept time with her hands and<lb/>
feet, spinning round, clapping her hands, knocking her knees<lb/>
together, in a wild, fantastic sort of time, and producing in her<lb/>
 <figure place="inline"><graphic url="images/hol_pg_0279detail.jpg"/></figure>
throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the<lb/>
native music of her race; and &#64257;nally, turning a somerset or<lb/>
two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and unearthly<lb/>
as that of a steam-whistle, she came suddenly down on the<lb/>
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most <choice><orig>sanctimo-<lb/>nious</orig>
 <reg>sanctimonious<lb/></reg></choice> expression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only<lb/>

<p n="19"><s n="34">&#8220;Augustine, you know I did&#8239;n&#x2019;t think of it in that light,&#8221;<lb/>
said Miss Ophelia, evidently softening.</s> <s n="35">&#8220;Well, it might be a<lb/>

<p n="20"><s n="36">St. Clare had touched the right string.</s> <s n="37">Miss Ophelia&#x2019;s <choice><orig>con-<lb/>scientiousness</orig>

<s n="40">You are so good, after all, that there&#8239;&#x2019;s no sense in them.</s> <s n="41">Why,<lb/>
the fact is, this concern belonged to a couple of drunken <choice><orig>crea-<lb/>tures</orig>
 <reg>creatures<lb/></reg></choice> that keep a low restaurant that I have to pass by every<lb/>

<p n="22"><s n="45">&#8220;Well, I&#8239;&#x2019;ll do what I can,&#8221; said Miss Ophelia; and she<lb/>
approached her new subject very much as a person might be<lb/>

benevolent designs toward it.</s></p>
<p n="23"><s n="46">&#8220;She&#8239;&#x2019;s dreadfully dirty, and half naked,&#8221; she said.</s></p>

<p n="29"><s n="58">Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that<lb/>

very ungracious and reluctant assistance from Jane.</s></p>
<p n="30"><s n="59">It is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the &#64257;rst<lb/>

 <reg>described.<lb/></reg></choice></s> <s n="61">Miss Ophelia had a good, strong, practical deal of<lb/>
resolution; and she went through all the disgusting details<lb/>
with heroic thoroughness, though, it must be confessed, with no<lb/>
very gracious air,&#8212;for endurance was the utmost to which<lb/>
her principles could bring her.</s> <s n="62">When she saw, on the back<lb/>

 <pb facs="hol_pg_0282" n="282"/>
and shoulders of the child, great welts and calloused spots,<lb/>
ine&#64256;aceable marks of the system under which she had grown<lb/>
up thus far, her heart became pitiful within her.</s></p>
<p n="31"><s n="63">&#8220;See there!&#8221; said Jane, pointing to the marks, &#8220;don&#x2019;t that<lb/>
show she&#8239;&#x2019;s a limb?</s> <s n="64">We&#8239;&#x2019;ll have &#64257;ne works with her, I reckon.</s><lb/>

<p n="32"><s n="68">The &#8220;young un&#8221; alluded to heard all these comments with<lb/>
the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her, only<lb/>

the ornaments which Jane wore in her ears.</s> <s n="69">When arrayed at<lb/>
last in a suit of decent and whole clothing, her hair cropped<lb/>
short to her head, Miss Ophelia, with some satisfaction, said she<lb/>
looked more Christian-like than she did, and in her own mind<lb/>
began to mature some plans for her instruction.</s></p>

  <p n="179"><s n="314">&#8220;O, Augustine, be still,&#8221; said Miss Ophelia; &#8220;how can I<lb/>

<p n="180"><s n="315">&#8220;Well, I won&#x2019;t disturb the exercises again, on my honor&#8221;;<lb/>
and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till<lb/>
Topsy had &#64257;nished her recitations.</s> <s n="316">They were all very well,<lb/>
only that now and then she would oddly transpose some <choice><orig>im-<lb/>portant</orig>
 <reg>important<lb/></reg></choice> words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every e&#64256;ort<lb/>
to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his promises of <choice><orig>good-<lb/>ness,</orig>

<p n="181"><s n="317">&#8220;How do you think I can do anything with the child, if you<lb/>

<p n="185"><s n="322">&#8220;You wanted me to bring her up right; and you ought to<lb/>

in time, as accustomed as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia<lb/>

a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer.</s> <s n="327">Topsy,<lb/>
whenever her sins brought her into disgrace in other quarters,<lb/>
always took refuge behind his chair; and St. Clare, in one way<lb/>
or other, would make peace for her.</s> <s n="328">From him she got many<lb/>
a stray picayune, which she laid out in nuts and candies, and<lb/>
distributed, with careless generosity, to all the children in the<lb/>
family; for Topsy, to do her justice, was good-natured and <choice><orig>lib-<lb/>eral,</orig>
 <reg>liberal,<lb/></reg></choice> and only spiteful in self-defence.</s> <s n="329">She is fairly introduced<lb/>
into our <hi rend="italic">corps de ballet</hi>, and will &#64257;gure, from time to time, in<lb/>
her turn, with other performers.</s></p>
