teeth.</s> <s n="7">Her woolly hair was braided in sundry<lb/>
little tails, which stuck out in every direction.</s><lb/>
<s n="8">The expression of her face was an odd mixture of<lb/>
shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly<lb/>
 drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the<lb/>
most doleful gravity and solemnity.</s> <s n="9">She was<lb/>
dressed in a single &#64257;lthy, ragged garment, made<lb/>

<p n="8"><s n="15">The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of<lb/>
 wicked drollery, and the thing struck up, in a<lb/>
clear, shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to which<lb/>
she kept time with her hands and feet, spinning<lb/>
round, clapping her hands, knocking her knees<lb/>
together, in a wild, fantastic sort of time, and<lb/>
producing in her throat all those odd guttural<lb/>
sounds which distinguish the native music of her<lb/>
race; and, &#64257;nally, turning a summerset or two,<lb/>
and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and<lb/>
unearthly as that of the steam-whistle, she came<lb/>
suddenly down on the carpet, and stood with her<lb/>
hands folded, and a most sanctimonious <choice><orig>expres-<lb/>sion</orig>
