            &#x201c;My inheritance, how wide and fair!/ 
                  Time is my estate; to time I&#x2019;m heir,&#x201d; from Johann Wolfgang
                  von Goethe&#x2019;s Wilhelm Meister (1795-1796), as translated by
               Thomas Carlyle and quoted at the beginning of the first American edition of
                     Sartor Resartus, ed. by Ralph Waldo Emerson (Boston: James
                  Munroe, 1836). As Dedmond notes, Carlyle&#x2019;s epigraph was omitted from later
               editions (147). Remaining citations come from the scholarly edition of
                     Sartor Resartus edited by Rodger L. Tarr et al (Berekely:
                  University of California Press, 2000).<a href="#nr1"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

               prominent theme in Carlyle, who argues that we should focus on producing things of
               value during each day.<a href="#nr2"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Almost a direct quote of John 9.4 (King James version): &#x201c;I
                  must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when
                  no man can work.&#x201d; Dedmond (147) notes that Carlyle ends the &#x201c;Everlasting
               Yea&#x201d; chapter with a version of this verse: &#x201c;Work while it is called To-day;
                  for the Night cometh, wherein no man can work.&#x201d;
               Leon Jackson (&#x201c;The Reader Retailored: Thomas Carlyle, His American Audience,
                  and the Politics of Evidence,&#x201d; Book History II [1999]: 158, 170) says &#x201c;the
               fact that Cranch also quotes two lines from Goethe from the title page of Sartor
               suggests that he was thinking more of the Scottish author than the Gospel one.&#x201d; <a href="#nr3"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch echoes Emerson&#x2019;s opening in the first chapter of
                  Nature: &#x201c;To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from
               his chamber as from society&#x201d; (CW 8).<a href="#nr4"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Action] Following his metaphor of the &#x201c;stream of time,&#x201d; Cranch
               echoes Carlyle, who in Sartor Resartus says that &#x201c;the articulated Word
               sets all hands in Action&#x201d; (47). See also his quoting the Erdgeist
               in Faust: &#x201c;In Being&#x2019;s floods, in Action&#x2019;s storm,/ 
                  I walk and work, above, beneath,/

            beautiful meaning] Dwight had written a similar line about
               Tennyson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Claribel,&#x201d; which is &#x201c;full of meaning, felt to the soul,&#x201d; given its &#x201c;vague

               through the subtle melody of mere verse?&#x201d; (quoted in Thomas 433). Dwight said
               elsewhere that the poems of Wordsworth, too, like Goethe, &#x201c;are never dull&#x201d; and &#x201c;are
               always steeped in the music of the man.&#x201d; (&#x201c;The Poetical Works of Edmund

            &#x201c;see into the life of things&#x201d;] From Wordsworth&#x2019;s &#x201c;Tintern Abbey&#x201d;:
                     &#x201c;Almost suspended, we are laid asleep/ 
                  In Body, and become a living soul:/ 
                  While, with an eye made quiet by the power/ 
                  Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,/ 
                  We see into the life of things&#x201d; (lines 47-49). This too was one of
               Emerson&#x2019;s favorite poems, according to his journal entry of May 25, 1837
                     (Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks, 335), which
               anticipates the &#x201c;transparent eyeball&#x201d; passage in Nature (for more in
               this see Patrick J. Keane&#x2019;s Emerson, Romanticism, and Intuitive Reason:
                     The Transatlantic &#x201c;Light of All Our Day&#x201d; [Columbia: University of
                  Missouri Press, 2005], especially pages 100&#x2013;107, on Emerson and
               Wordsworth). Compare also the &#x201c;Symbols&#x201d; chapter of Sartor Resartus:
                  &#x201c;In the Symbol [. . .] the Infinite is made to blend itself with the
                  Finite, to stand visible, and as it were, attainable there&#x201d; (162). Dedmond
               (147) notes that the Western Messenger featured Carlyle&#x2019;s
                  Miscellanies in its &#x201c;Critical Notices&#x201d; (edited by Cranch) in
               December 1838. In it &#x201c;C&#x201d; (which is probably Cranch, though it could be Clarke)
               writes, &#x201c;We know of no life-reviewer equal to Carlyle. He has an eye to see
                  into the soul of man as well asunder beneath his keen philosophical glance, as
                  distinct as Day from Night&#x201d; (5: 138).<a href="#nr9"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            &#x201c;had all knowledge&#x201d;] Dedmond points to I Corinthians
                  13:2 (King James version): &#x201c;And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
               understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I
               could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.&#x201d; This also follows a

               of a month&#x2019;s or a year&#x2019;s issue of new books, seems to me with a little qualification
               true of the age [. . .] One man, two men, &#x2014; possibly, three or four, &#x2014; have cast
               behind them a long-descended costume of the academy, and the expectations of fashion,
               and have said, This world is too fair, this world comes home too near to me than I
               should walk a stranger in it, and live at second hand, fed by other men&#x2019;s doctrines,
               or treading only in their steps&#x201d; (Early Lectures 361). Clearly this
               also follows the general theme in &#x201c;The American Scholar&#x201d; that significant truths
               derive not from necessarily books but from an engagement with nature&#x2014;&#x201c;instead of Man
               Thinking, we have the bookworm&#x201d; (CW 56).<a href="#nr13"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Following his precept in the &#x201c;Everlasting No&#x201d; chapter of
                  Sartor Resartus to not know thyself, but "know what thou canst work
               at," Carlyle asks a rhetorical question: &#x201c;Hast thou a certain Faculty, a certain
               Worth, such even as the most have not; or art thou the completest Dullard of these
               modern times? Alas, the fearful Unbelief is unbelief in yourself; and how could I
               believe?&#x201d; (123). The &#x201c;skepticism&#x201d; recalls Carlyle&#x2019;s arguments against &#x201c;our Age of
               Skepticism&#x201d; induced by the Voltaire, Hume, the French Revolution, materialism, and
               British Utilitarianism, saying in his &#x201c;State of German Literature&#x201d; essay that German
               writers provide spiritual sustenance to people hampered by skepticism, which has made
               Europe &#x201c;a scene blackened and burnt-up with fire; mourning in the darkness, because
               there is desolation, and no home for the soul&#x201d; (26:85). Carlyle&#x2019;s transcendentalist
               attitude combats a morbid self-consciousness, as in &#x201c;Characteristics,&#x201d; written just
               after Sartor: &#x201c;Our whole relations to the Universe and to our
               fellow-man have become an Inquiry, a Doubt&#x201d; (28:19). Compare also Emerson&#x2019;s
               &#x201c;Religion&#x201d; lecture, in which he warns of &#x201c;profound unbelief, &#x2014; a diffidence&#x201d;
               resulting from the fact that &#x201c;society sickens of skepticism&#x201d; (Early
                  Lectures 97).<a href="#nr14"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>
            <div class="note"><a name="note15"></a>15.
            Here Cranch echoes the primary message of Emerson&#x2019;s first chapter
               of Nature, the synthesis of soul and nature: &#x201c;Nature always wears the
               colors of the spirit&#x201d; (CW 10)&#x2014;which harkens back to Carlyle&#x2019;s metaphor of the
               philosophy of clothes in Sartor Resartus.<a href="#nr15"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            After leaving for Boston that year, Clarke asked Cranch to assume
               his position as editor for at least two issues. When Clarke returned to Louisville in
               late December, he exalted in the &#x201c;exquisite keenness of [Emerson&#x2019;s] intellect and
               antique charm of his imagination,&#x201d; resolving to stand behind &#x201c;a man whose life is
               holiness, whose words are gems, whose character is of the purest type of heroism, yet
               of childlike simplicity&#x201d; (quoted in Miller 35).<a href="#nr16"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>
            <div class="note"><a name="note17"></a>17.
            Cranch experienced the same problem the last time he was in
               Louisville, as indicated in a 21 November 1838 letter to Clarke: &#x201c;Our river is up
               once more, and everything alive and stirring. &#x2018;Da regte sich was Hande hat,&#x2019; etc.&#x201d;
               (MHS typescript).<a href="#nr17"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            <u>natural</u> and <u>free</u>]Cranch echoes Emerson&#x2019;s saying in &#x201c;Heroism&#x201d; that &#x201c;A great man scarcely
               knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision, his living is
               natural and poetic.&#x201d; An early version of &#x201c;Heroism&#x201d; was delivered as a lecture in
               Boston in the winter of 1837, as part of his lectures on "Human Culture." See also
               the Introduction to this edition for more on how &#x201c;natural and free&#x201d; comes from
               Dwight&#x2019;s musical aesthetics.<a href="#nr18"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Truth &amp; Duty] This illustrates not only the influence of
               Kant's categorical imperative, but also the Calvanistic strains of Cranch&#x2019;s thought.
               As Miller suggests, Cranch was raised in a Puritan household, and &#x201c;God&#x2019;s
                  immanence and man&#x2019;s duty to God were real truths for him&#x201d; (10). Cranch&#x2019;s
               Puritanical lineage compares to Emerson, whose Aunt Mary was likewise Puritanical in
               her many letters to him in his formative years.<a href="#nr19"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            The grammar of the sentence makes it unclear as to whether the
               &#x201c;Sartorish&#x201d; letter was written to his mother or to Appleton; in any case, I was not
               able to locate the letter.<a href="#nr20"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Dedmond (148) cites Clarke&#x2019;s letter to Emerson from 11 March 1839:
               &#x201c;Cranch and I were so profane as to illustrate some of your sayings by sketches not
               of the gravest character. I should like to show them to you, for I think you would
               like them. . . . C. P Cranch has quite a talent at drawing diablerie &amp; such like&#x201d;
                     (The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. Ralph L. Rusk
                  [New York: Columbia University Press, 1939], 2:190). In a 20 May 1839
               letter to Clarke, Cranch then commented on these drawings: &#x201c;By the way, I lent
               [Furness] my Emersonian scraps to take on with him, and it seems by sundry external
               signs upon them since they were returned to me, that they have been considerably
               thumbed and pocketed. Great men have looked upon them. The genius of a Dewey and a
               Channing hath stopped to smile condescendingly on them. Our fame, friend, groweth. It
               hath been budding with the spring. We are linked in celebrity, and thus will descend
               to posterity as the immortal illustrators of the great Transcendentalist! When all
               trades fail, let us take to caricaturing. We have humors that way&#x201d; (MHS typescript).

            &#x201c;swallows all formulas&#x201d;] Cranch is probably thinking of Carlyle&#x2019;s
               translation of Mirabeau&#x2019;s saying about himself&#x2014;il a humé toutes le formules&#x2014;in his
               Memoirs (Historical Essays [Berkeley, CA: University of
                  California Press, 2002]: 188). Cranch had also probably read a related
               passage from The French Revolution, Vol II, Book III, Ch. VII, &#x201c;Death
               of Mirabeau,&#x201d; which came out in 1838: &#x201c;So blazes out, far-seen, a Man&#x2019;s Life, and
               becomes ashes and a caput mortuum, in this World-Pyre, which we name French
               Revolution: not the first that consumed itself there; nor, by thousands and many
               millions, the last! A man who &#x2018;had swallowed all formulas&#x2019;; who, in these strange
               times and circumstances, felt called to live Titanically, and also to die so. As he,
               for his part, had swallowed all formulas, what Formula is there, never so
               comprehensive, that will express truly the plus and the minus of him, give us the
               accurate net-result of him? There is hitherto none such&#x201d; (A Carlyle
                     Reader (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984):
               363).<a href="#nr22"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Compare Cranch&#x2019;s own words in &#x201c;A Letter on Travelling,&#x201d; in the
               June 1838 Messenger: &#x201c;Well, here I am&#x2014;again a wanderer&#x2014;another, and
               still another parting have I endured. For nearly three years it has been my lot to
               rove from place to place, North, South, East, West&#x2014;making friends and parting from
               them&#x2014;verily, I am growing aweary of such itinerant ways of living&#x201d; (Western
                  Messenger, 5 [June 1838]: 183.). Emerson warned against the dangers of
               travelling in Self-Reliance: &#x201c;the rage of travelling is a symptom of a
               deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is
               vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our
               bodies are forced to stay at home.&#x201d; That thought could have had its genesis in &#x201c;The
               Individual,&#x201d; where he quotes the adage, &#x201c;To know that the sky is everywhere blue, you
               need not travel round the world&#x201d; and says, &#x201c;I travel faster than you. In my closet I
               see more and anticipate all your wonders&#x201d; (Early Lectures 178&#x2013;9). See
               also Dedmond, p. 133.<a href="#nr23"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch hits upon one of Emerson&#x2019;s most significant doctrines,
               namely, that compensation illustrates a balanced wholeness; the world consists of
                  &#x201c;relations of parts and the end of the whole remaining the same.&#x201d;
               The virtuous consider in their actions the &#x201c;whole circle of persons and
                  things, of actions and events, of country and religion, not as painfully
                  accumulated, atom after atom, act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one
                  vast picture, which God paints on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of
                  the soul&#x201d; (CW 29, 36). Cranch could also be thinking of
               Emerson&#x2019;s early lecture, &#x201c;On the Relation of Man to the Globe&#x201d; (Early Lectures
               21-59), which set the groundwork for compensation as a fundamental truth (even though
               the word &#x201c;compensation&#x201d; does not appear in the lecture and in Nature). <a href="#nr24"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            In a 9 February 1839 letter to A. H., Clarke himself entertained
               doubts about &#x201c;the expediency of my leaving Louisville&#x201d; and expounded that &#x201c;I have no
               such serious purpose, but at times I am &#x2018;exercised in mind&#x2019; about the propriety of so
               doing. It often seems to me as if some one else could do more good than I here, and I
               do more good somewhere else. I am by no means a popular preacher in this place, nor
               ever shall be. ... I am extremely anxious in this matter to be guided solely by duty.
               . . . William Channing urged me so strongly to retain the &#x2018;Western Messenger&#x2019; that I
               have agreed to do so till the end of the sixth number, volume vi. Then I hope they
               will take it to Cincinnati. C. P. Cranch stayed three weeks with me after I reached
               home, and I grew to love him very much, and he me&#x201d; (James Freeman
                     Clarke: Autobiography, Diary, and Correspondence, ed. Edward Everett

            On 14 October 1837 Cranch had written to his sister Margaret: &#x201c;I
               went the other night to see Mr. Keats, an English gentleman residing here, and
               brother to Keats, the poet. He seemed to be a very intelligent and gentlemanly man,
               and has some daughters, only one of whom I saw, a young lady about fourteen years
               apparently, with face and features strongly resembling Keats, the poet, or that
               little portrait of him which you see in the volume containing his poems in
               conjunction with Coleridge and Shelley. I could scarcely keep my eyes from her
               countenance, so striking was the likeness&#x201d; (Scott 38&#x2013;9). See also Denise Gigante&#x2019;s
               study of the Keats brothers, The Keats Brothers: The Life of John and

            Semi-Colon was a primarily Unitarian social club consisting mostly
               of writers and intellectuals. The Beecher sisters were among its members, and the
               club played a part in launching the career of Harriet Beecher Stowe (see
                  Forrest Wilson&#x2019;s Crusader in Crinoline: A Life of Harriet Beecher
                     Stowe [New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1941]: 122&#x2013;6).
               Semi-Colon provided as much-needed intellectual stimulation in a city that otherwise
               lacked the urbanity of the Boston area. See Louis Tucker, &#x201c;The Semi-Colon Club
                  of Cincinnati,&#x201d; Ohio History, 73.1 (1964). For an essay on
               the gendered aspects of the Semi-Colon members, women writers, and its hostesses
               (including a section on Cranch&#x2019;s relation to club), see Nicole Tonkovich&#x2019;s
                  &#x201c;Writing in Circles,&#x201d; in Nineteenth-Century Women Learn To Write
                  (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1995): 149&#x2013;178. Cranch
               praised Semi-Colon for providing freedom for more advanced writers as well as
               &#x201c;emboldened beginners to a spontaneity of thought and style&#x201d; (Library of Congress
               manuscript; quoted in Tonkovich 152). Tonkovich also challenges the accuracy of
               Parker, Cranch, and the biographer Wilson&#x2019;s take on the club&#x2019;s responsibility for
               bolstering Stowe&#x2019;s career.<a href="#nr27"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            &#x201c;Dreams&#x201d; appeared in the Western Messenger, 6
                  (June 1839): 98&#x2013;100. Of interest is his rhetorical question, &#x201c;may it
                  not be, that dreams are one way in which the spiritual gains access to the
                  spirit's ear [. . .] ?&#x201d; The &#x201c;imprisoned spirit&#x201d; looks to the Imagination
               for spiritual answers. No doubt this piece later informed Cranch&#x2019;s poem, &#x201c;The Three
               Muses,&#x201d; in which he describes a waking dream of a bewildered traveler, and one muse
               calls upon &#x201c;the truth sublime&#x201d; of &#x201c;The soul within the soul, the hidden
                     life,/ 
                  The fount of dreams, the vision and the strife/ 
                  Of thoughts that seized on every other force,/ 
                  And turned it to their own resistless course&#x201d; (The
                     Bird and the Bell, And Other Poems [Boston: James R. Osgood and
                  Company, 1875]: 31). Surely Cranch was affected by Nature,
               in which Emerson claims that &#x201c;the world is a divine dream,&#x201d; and
                  &#x201c;a dream may let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred
                  concerted experiments&#x201d; (CW37, 39).<a href="#nr28"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch wrote to Clarke on 22 January about the party: &#x201c;Last night
               I went to a Semicolon party at Mrs. Stetson&#x2019;s. We had a glorious time. The pieces
               were good, and the music refreshing; and dancing&#x2014;heavens! how they danced. &#x2018;Old men
               and maidens gay&#x2019;, whose heads seemed almost topsyturveyed. It was one of the most
               delightful seasons of social refreshment I ever enjoyed. A perfect inundation of
               spirits, whose merry and sparkling utterances seemed to set afloat in mere
               kindliness, the most staid and old, who at first were prone to root themselves to the
               sides of the room in their chairs. &#x2018;Such music flows from kind hearts, in a kind
               environment of time and peace.&#x2019; &#x2018;The poor claims of me and thee vanished.&#x2019; We were
               all as one&#x201d; (MHS typescript).<a href="#nr29"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            In an undated fragment of a journal or letter (in typescript),
               Cranch expressed his annoyance with &#x201c;over-cautious and conservative Unitarians of
               Massachusetts&#x201d; who took issue with his work at the Western Messenger
               (MHS). He was also not afraid to poke at them: see his poem (signed &#x201c;X&#x201d;) in the May
               1838 (Vol. V) issue of the Western Messenger&#x2014; "Surely our
                     preachers should have warmth of soul,/  And yet we hear of Unitarian
                     coldness&#x2014; / We have our Green-wood, Furness, Burn-up, Cole,/ 
                  And Flint and sparks once blazed away with boldness,/ 
                  And now along with names so warm and zealous,/ 
                  There&#x2019;s lately come to kindle us, a Bellows." For a similar play on

            Perkins had written in a letter to a friend, just after he became
               minister-at-large, that the individual spirit was being lost to the whims of the
               masses: &#x201c;The mantle of Minister at Large has fallen upon me, and in this vocation I
               hope somewhat to realize that usefulness to which you allude as the crowning gift of
               man. The field is wide and undug; my spade is dull and weak. . . . Pauperism,
               Poverty, Infidelity, Vice, Crime, - these are five well-armed and most determined
               demons to war with, - true children of the world, the flesh, and the Devil, which,
               jockey-like, cross and recross their breeds for ever&#x201d; (Memoirs and
                     Writings of James Handasyd Perkins, ed. William Henry Channing
                  [Cincinnati: Trueman &amp; Spofford, 1851] 1:114-15). His chief objective
               was &#x201c;to form such connections with the poor as will enable us, in some degree at
               least, to withdraw them and their children from evil associations, and to combine
               immediate physical relief with continued moral relief; and second, to find those in
               need employment&#x201d; (1:118-19; quoted in Dedmond 148).<a href="#nr31"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            &#x201c;cement&#x201d;] Cranch may have taken this metaphor from Emerson&#x2019;s 1833
               lecture &#x201c;The Uses of Natural History,&#x201d; in which he encourages strong minds to
               sympathize with all fellow beings: &#x201c;Where is it these fair creatures (in whom an
               order and series is so distinctly discernable) find their link, their cement, their
               keystone, but in the Mind of Man. It is he who marries the visible to the Invisible
               by uniting thought to Animal Organization&#x201d; (Early Lectures 24). Also,
               he might be remembering the thought from &#x201c;Water,&#x201d; in which Emerson speaks of the
               friend who &#x201c;is present in every function of life, grows in the vegetable, is a
               cement, and an engineer, and an architect, in inanimate nature&#x201d; (ibid 51).<a href="#nr32"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Starting in March 1839, Channing would spend three years as the
               lead pastor in the Unitarian church of Cincinnati. See Octavius Brooks

            Compare to Cranch&#x2019;s poem, &#x201c;Original Ode&#x201d;:  &#x201c;We gather by
                     wild stream and wood/ 
                  In a far Western land&#x201d;/  &#x2026; &#x201c;When by the Rock on Plymouth&#x2019;s shore/ 
                  They moored their lonely bark,/

            Cranch had written similarly in an August 1837 letter to Clarke,
               saying he is &#x201c;reserved, secretive, proud, indolent, but above all diffident.
                  This besetting diffidence lies at the root of all my reserve, and keeps me again
                  and again silent and seemingly cold, when no one could tell how deep and strong
                  the stream which ran hidden within&#x201d; (Scott 35).<a href="#nr36"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch did not leave Cincinnati until around 2 March.<a href="#nr37"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Bertha and Kate were the daughters of Mrs. Wood, with whom the
               Cranch brothers had their meals.<a href="#nr38"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            On 23 May 1840, Cranch wrote Clarke that he was &#x201c;getting to
                  be somewhat of a Swedenborgian. ... I do not think we study him enough. ... For my
                  part, I could be a New Church man, were it not for the doctrine of the identity of
                  Jesus and God&#x201d; (MHS typescript; see also Dedmond 148&#x2013;9).<a href="#nr39"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            loaves &amp; the fishes] In his Remarks on the Four
                  Gospels, one of the most important books Cranch read in 1836 alongside
                  Nature, William Henry Furness devotes a chapter to the miracles,
               arguing that the word comes from the Latin miraculum, meaning &#x201c;wonder,&#x201d; and that
               Jesus&#x2019;s miracles were wonders of &#x201c;moral elevation&#x201d; rather than supernatural feats
                     (Remarks on the Four Gospels [Philadelphia: Carey, Lea
                  &amp; Blanchard, 1836]: 145&#x2013;6). He also quotes William Ellery Channing&#x2019;s
               remarks that God&#x2019;s purpose is to establish the &#x201c;order of Nature,&#x201d; &#x201c;and miracles,
               instead of warring against, would concur with nature&#x201d; (147&#x2013;8). Another connection is
               Cranch&#x2019;s Eliot relatives, who, as Cynthia Grant Tucker writes, &#x201c;were happy to
                  leave the Virgin Birth and Three-Person God to the orthodox&#x201d; and were
                  &#x201c;willing to forfeit the miracles, the loaves and the fishes,&#x201d;
               conceding to logic and natural philosophy (No Silent Witness: The Eliot
                     Parsonage Women and Their Unitarian World [New York: Oxford University
                  Press, 2010]: 235).<a href="#nr40"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            In a 16 February 1839 letter to Clarke, Cranch admitted that
                  &#x201c;I have been a regular loafer here. Living in a dusty, noisy law office,
                  and sleeping in the same on a most extemporaneous couch-bed, without a
                  pillow,&#x2014;very unsettled and inactive.&#x201d; He also indicated his weariness with
               his intrepid lifestyle: &#x201c;Heartily tired am I of wandering. I want a home;
                  quiet steady work, and a wife. I shall not find them this side of the
                  mountains&#x201d; (Scott 46).<a href="#nr41"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

                   &#x201c;Then had I not been thus exiled from light,/

            On 6 March, after a boat trip up the Ohio River to Wheeling,
               Cranch took the stagecoach to Frederick, Maryland, and then traveled by train to
               Washington. He left Mrs. Lynch and Lucas in Frederick (Dedmond 149).<a href="#nr44"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            In an 8 March letter to his brother Edward, Cranch wrote that
               &#x201c;Rufus [Dawes] is sitting with me in the old library, reading Carlyle. We had a long
               talk this morning about the New Church. He talks grandly about it, and almost makes
               me in love with the system of Swedenborg. He thinks most of the Unitarians today will
               all come round to the New Church before long&#x201d; (Cranch Collection, University of
               Wyoming; quoted in Dedmond 149).<a href="#nr45"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Dedmond (149) notes that Cranch wrote to Edward on 8 March: &#x201c;I
               have not yet seen Greenleaf Bulfinch. He is busy moving&#x201d; (Cranch Collection, WyU).
               The February 1838 Western Messenger published a &#x201c;discourse&#x201d; by S. G.
               Bulfinch, then pastor of the Unitarian Church in Pittsburgh. Cranch kept close with
               him, as is indicated by a 13 August 1843 letter to Dwight, in which he claims that he
               is now living &#x201c;in perpetual creation&#x201d; and welcomes his new poverty, Cranch indicates
               that he &#x201c;preached one sermon only for Bulfinch, as he needed help&#x201d; (Scott 82).<a href="#nr47"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch was probably reading Cousin&#x2019;s Elements of
                     Psychology: Included in a Critical Examination of Locke&#x2019;s Essay on the Human
                     Understanding (New York: Gould &amp; Newman, 1838). On 21 June
               1839 Cranch wrote Edward from Philadelphia: &#x201c;I am also continuing to read Cousin. He
               does much to strengthen my faith&#x201d; (MHS typescript; quoted in Dedmond 149).<a href="#nr48"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

               theme of poetry as dream-making. The optimistic,
               thoroughly transcendentalist poem still attempts in &#x201c;Seeing in all things around,
               types of the Infinite Mind&#x201d;: &#x201c;Little dreaming the cause why to such terms he is
                  prone,/ 
               Little dreaming that every thing here has its own correspondence/ 
               Folded within its form, as in the body the soul&#x201d; (Poems,

            Nevertheless Cranch, who was at this time equally well-regarded
               among close friends for his musical as for his conversational abilities, once
               complained about the tediousness in staying in one place, day after day, "'as idle as a
               painted ship upon a painted ocean.&#x2019; I should think it was next to being becalmed at
               sea. The good folks here seem to have discovered my musical propensities and
               weaknessess, and I am accordingly made use of as unceremoniously as if I were a poor
               passive pitchpipe for everybody to sound. I fear my consenting to sing that
               everlasting &#x2018;Schoolmaster&#x2019; has proved the father of many future bores on my part. Two
               or three times already, have I bawled it out to the exercise of many cachinnatory
               muscles in the auditors thereof. Some of my German songs also, I have attempted. I
               flute all alone as yet, though I found a fine flute at Mr. G&#x2019;s&#x2014;, on which I played a
               little while there. . . . ." (MHS undated typescript of journal or letter fragment). <a href="#nr50"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            On 14 April, Cranch wrote Edward from Baltimore: &#x201c;I shall be in
               Balt. a few days &#x2013; they want me to stay over another Sunday, but I shall not have
               time. Next Sunday I intend to preach in Phila spend a few days in New York, &amp;
               be in Boston the last week in April. Where I shall then go, I know not yet. Perhaps
               to Northampton. Mr. Briggs said he would try to arrange it. There are many vacant
               parishes in N.E.&#x201d; (quoted in Dedmond 149).<a href="#nr51"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Dedmond quotes Cranch&#x2019;s reflection in &#x201c;The Book of Thoughts,&#x201d; an
               unpublished commonplace book, c. 1872-79, pp. 191-93, in which he lamented his
               &#x201c;misfortune (as regards worldly &amp; pecuniary success) to have too many sides&#x2014;to
               have been born (and educated) with a diversity of talents . . . I have wooed too many
               mistresses; and the world punishes me for not shutting my eyes to all charmers but
               one&#x201d; (MHS; Dedmond 149).<a href="#nr52"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            In a 22 September 1891 scrap from a letter or journal, Cranch
               recalled this time in more detail: "In 1839 I preached a sermon in Dr. Furness&#x2019;
               pulpit in Philadelphia, and afterwards in several other pulpits, in which the leading
               idea, if I remember, was&#x2014;all life has a [sic]tendancy upwards. The mineral is taken
               up by the vegetable, this into the animal, the animal into the intellectual, and the
               intellectual into the spiritual. He that loseth life shall find it. The lower life is
               lost that the higher may survive. I remember preaching it once at the Thursday
               lecture in Boston, when Mr. Emerson was one of my hearers, and that he was interested
               in it. The MS. was lost&#x2014;burnt up with all my old sermons in the fire that destroyed
               the old De Windt homestead in 1862, with all my books and my letters, and other
               things I hardly remember now" (MHS typescript).<a href="#nr53"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch revealed in a 21 June 1839 letter from Philadelphia that
               &#x201c;The people are not sociable. There is an air of stiffness, reserve,&#x2014; a disposition
               which even their very houses manifest upon their fronts&#x2014;to keep by themselves, to
               keep their hands behind them at the approach of a stranger. There is nothing of the
               cordiality of manner you meet with in the West. // I can&#x2019;t say I have been at all
               industrious since I have been here.&#x201d; He recalled writing two sermons, one on &#x2018;The
               voice crying in the wilderness, &#x201c;which the superficial might say was upholding
               &#x2018;Transcendentalism&#x2019;&#x201d; and another on &#x201c;Sects,&#x201d; &#x201c;in which I took the ground that sects
               were not only unavoidable, and not to be regretted, but were necessary to the
               development of truth&#x201d; (MHS typescript). See Appendix 2<a href="#Appendix2" name=""><span class="noteRef">
                []
            </span></a> for
               another section of this letter containing a poem on Cousin and Transcendentalism. <a href="#nr54"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Cranch probably learned about Jouffroy from being in Cincinnati
               with William Henry Channing, who was working on a translation of
                     Introduction to Ethics, Including a Critical Survey of Moral
                     Systems in two volumes for the Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature
                  series (Boston: Hilliard, Gray, 1840-41). <a href="#nr55"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            Probably Psalm 4:6 (King James Bible):
                  &#x201c;There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord lift thou up the
                  light of thy countenance upon us.&#x201d;<a href="#nr56"><img src="images/goback.png" alt="Go&#xA;                        back"></img></a></div>

            <h1>Appendix 1</h1>
            <div class="p"><em>From the May 20, 1839 letter to Clarke, with
                  further comments on the draft caricatures, the ministry, and the</em> Western
               Messenger.</div>
            <div class="p">Albeit I wrote the last letter which passed between us, my pen yearneth to speak to
               thee again. I know that my poor epistles scarce deserve the happiness of being
               replied to, by such as thine&#x2014;and perhaps in the multitude of cares&#x2014;amid sermons and
               editorials, and multifarious readings and writings you hardly find time to bestow so
               much of yourself upon your correspondents as they could desire. Yet, verily, this
               shall not deter me from communing with thee, my friend; this is a pleasure I can not
               easily relinquish. Having had one sip of the fountain, I would not willingly be
               removed from it. Send forth, therefore, I beseech thee, a few drops of thy refreshing
               streams. My heart will bless you for it, if my poor wits can not adequately repay
               you.</div>
            <div class="p">I have taken up my abode you perceive in this Philadelphia, and am minister to the
               new society at the &#x201c;Northern Liberties&#x201d; for some weeks. They are at present a feeble
               folk like the conies, and poor in this world&#x2019;s goods; but I trust they may increase,
               and their latter end be respectable. I should like it right well, could I be the
               means of building up a church among them. Time will show what can be done. I have
               been supplying Mr. Furness&#x2019; pulpit a few Sundays, while he went northward. By the
               way, I lent him my Emersonian scraps [sketches] to take on with him, and it seems by
               sundry external signs upon them since they were returned to me, that they have been
               considerably thumbed and pocketed. Great men have looked upon them. The genius of a
               Dewey and a Channing hath stopped to smile condescendingly on them. Our fame, friend,
               groweth. It hath been budding with the spring. We are linked in celebrity, and thus
               will descend to posterity as the immortal illustrators of the great
               Transcendentalist! When all trades fail, let us take to caricaturing. We have humors
               that way. I did not, by the way, hear the echo of your laugh over the last scraps I
               sent you from Washington. Pray tell me if you received them safe out of the vulgar
               hands of the men of the post office. I would not have these sacred mysteries bared to
               common daylight and to uninitiated and vulgar risibilities. Pray tell me that you
               received them. I heard in fancy your laugh for a week. Do write that laugh on paper,
               and send us a scrap of your own.</div>
            <div class="p">O my brother, we need your poetic faculty to quicken us in this life. My wits have
               brought forth little but thorns and weeds since thy rain and sunshine were withdrawn.
               True, when I was at home, the quiet atmosphere of that loved spot, backed by the
               influences of the opening spring, and the bees and blossoms, did call forth some
               fruit&#x2014;such as it was. And I did commence a Spenserian stanza poem which I shall
               probably never complete. I wrote near forty stanzas. It is a love tale, thus far. But
               I got dissatisfied with it. I followed my own experience too closely. Besides, it
               does not look ministerial. Should I publish, what would the world say, etc.,
               etc.&#x2014;comes into my mind. What have I to do with writing and publishing such
               stuff?</div>
            <div class="p">I perceive you are relieved of the immediate care of the &#x201c;Messenger&#x201d;. I wish you joy.
               I hope Channing will not mix in too much abolitionism. Look out for southern
               subscribers, if you don&#x2019;t take care.</div>
            <div class="p">I saw young Huidekoper a week ago, who was just about embarking for Europe. Chandler
               Robbins also I met in New York just before he sailed. I had a good time in New York
               at the dedication of Dewey&#x2019;s church. I don&#x2019;t like the name&#x2014;do you? He preached a
               grand sermon though. And Fanny Parkman who seems to be midwife general to all the
               churches which are legitimate, made an excellent dedicatory prayer.</div>
            <div class="p">But now, no more. Tempus est stopendi. Windum up est. Write to us if we have any
               place in your memory. Remember me to each and all of my good Louisville friends. I
               remember them all with interest.</div>
            <div class="p">Ever your friend and brother, <br></br>C. P. C. </div>
