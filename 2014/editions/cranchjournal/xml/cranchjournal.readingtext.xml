                <p>I begin this day a journal. I think I shall find it highly useful. I do not think
                    it necessary to record herein every day, of my life &#8212; but simply to record
                    such events, and note down such thoughts, feelings &amp; experiences as have a
                    more intimate connection with my mind &amp; character. A Journal should be a
                    reflection of the True Life &#8212; the interior being, experience &amp; growth
                    &#8212; a mirror of myself, to some extent. I intend to journalize more
                    systematically &amp; philosophically more than I have done. This book, now
                    blank, shall be my friend, my companion, my teacher &amp; monitor, as well as my
                    record. </p>
                <p rend="text-indent:-2em;">I need something of this sort. I need to retire back on
                        myself<ptr target="#note4" xml:id="nr4"/>&#8212; take an observation of my
                    longitude &amp; latitude in the boundless ocean of Eternity on which I am
                    sailing. I must look back. I must look forward &#8212; square my accounts. <fw
                        type="pagNum" place="top" rend="align(left)">2</fw> And post them,
                    clerk-like. I must ask myself, as I enter on this newyear, &amp; this
                    journalbook &#8212; how I stand, with myself, &amp; before God. Thus far I have
                    voyaged, by His all preserving &amp; continually upholding grace &#8212; Nearly
                    twenty six years have I been borne along the stream of time<ptr target="#note5"
                        xml:id="nr5"/> &#8212; a checkered Past! &#8212; various experiences!
                    &#8212; Has this Past been a <hi rend="double-underline">Teacher</hi> to me? God
                    grant it may have been, in some degree &#8212; Let not the years pass by me like
                    the wind, viewless, silent, forgotten! I have many defects, errors, weaknesses
                    to confess, O God, before Thee! Do thou grant strength &amp; light for the
                    future! Give me a more tender conscience &#8212; give me a firmer faith &#8212;
                    inspire me with that spiritual Mind which comes only from Thee! &#8212;</p>
                <p rend="text-indent:-2em;">And now, I am <hi rend="double-underline">Here</hi>. The
                    mystery of life has borne me to this point. And I must begin afresh, &amp; with
                    that resolution whose absence I continually mourn, yet too vainly, I must turn a
                    new leaf. &#8212; What I want &#8212; is <hi rend="underline">Action.</hi><ptr
                        target="#note6" xml:id="nr6"/> I must begin to <hi rend="underline"
                        >Live</hi> more in earnest, than I have done. <fw type="pagNum" place="top"
                        rend="align(right)">3</fw> It seems to me as if those lines of Wordsworth's
                    applied pointedly to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. What a beautiful meaning <ptr
                        target="#note7" xml:id="nr7"/> is in them! <lg type="poem">

                        rend="underline">realize</hi>. The great end of life is to <hi
                        rend="underline">realize</hi>. At present I only <hi rend="underline"
                        >dream</hi>. Half of my existence seems to be <hi rend="underline"
                        >dreaming</hi>. A deadly <hi rend="underline">Indifference</hi> hangs over
                    me &#8212; like a lethargy. It is partly temperament &#8212; &amp; partly a
                    habit of mind &#8212; I think. I must break this egg shell &#8212; out of this
                    prison I must forth. I must <hi rend="underline">realize</hi>, &amp; the way to
                    realize, is to give up dreaming and go to <hi rend="underline">acting</hi> &amp;

                    &#8212; And as to needed knowledge, will it not “come round” as Emerson says, to
                    him who works and truly lives &#8212; ? &#8212;<ptr target="#note11"
                        xml:id="nr11"/> I find my- <fw type="pagNum" place="top" rend="align(left)"
                        >4</fw> self perpetually repining that I am not familiar with books &#8212;
                    that I am so ignorant of things which every man almost knows. But if I may learn
                        <hi rend="underline">Things</hi> instead of books, shall I not be more truly
                    wise than if [I] “had all knowledge”.<ptr target="#note12" xml:id="nr12"/> And
                    will not this learning of <hi rend="double-underline">Things</hi> from the
                    actual collision of Life, be the very best preparation for book knowledge
                    &#8212; ?</p>
                <p rend="text-indent:-2em;">As it is now, I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> keep up
                    a thirst for truth. I am wholly indifferent to knowledge &#8212; except now
                    &amp; then, when excited. I am not fond of reading, except when a book happens
                    to suit my tastes in most respects. I enjoy <hi rend="underline">writing</hi> I
                    think more than reading. Nor do I <hi rend="underline">remember</hi> what I
                    read. Now were I more <hi rend="underline">alive</hi> &#8212; awake &#8212;
                    shaken up &#8212; by a more active, out of door life &#8212; much of this might
                    be remedied. I might see in <hi rend="double-underline">books</hi> but the <hi
                        rend="underline">reflection</hi> of what I experienced &amp; saw in <hi
                        rend="underline">life</hi>. Because I should be ever catching revealings of
                    truths <fw type="pagNum" place="top" rend="align(right)">5</fw> and realities at
                    first hand, I should be best prepared to appreciate them when seen at second
                        hand.<ptr target="#note13" xml:id="nr13"/> I shd remember better and thirst
                    for more habitually, the scattered truths in books. </p>
                <p rend="text-indent:-2em;">Then, I want Faith in myself. Unbelief in ourselves,
                    says Carlyle, is the worst skepticism.<ptr target="#note14" xml:id="nr14"/> I
                    want faith in my former impressions &amp; convictions, and aspirings. I want
                    Faith that I am a <hi rend="double-underline">Spirit</hi>: and that the hidden
                    energies of a Spirit are wrapped up in me.<ptr target="#note15" xml:id="nr15"/>
                    I must be a more independent <hi rend="underline">thinker</hi>. I must not be
                    afraid of my thought. I must love it, if it is an earnest &amp; true one, to
                    myself. I must be an independent <hi rend="underline">feeler</hi> &#8212; not
                    grieving if I do not think I feel deeply enough &#8212; but trying to be <hi
                        rend="underline">natural</hi>. I am not now natural enough. I am afraid of
                    those around me &#8212; They’ll think me affected, strange, undignified or lax
                    in principle &#8212; must not mind them. Do what is right and natural. Obey my
                    higher instincts.</p>

                    to know a mind and character like Jas. F. Clarke’s. I feel that it does me good
                    to be with him. While I feel my own weaknesses and defects in his society
                    &#8212; I feel that it is useful for me to be thus with a superior spirit. I may
                    be gathering material for thought &amp; action which will <fw type="pagNum"

                <p>Last night Clarke &amp; I amused ourselves making illustrations of Emerson’s
                    writings &#8212; see p. 10 &amp; 11.<ptr target="#note21" xml:id="nr21"/>
                    &#8212; We had real fun &#8212; instruction also. &#8212; </p>
                <p>This morning I preached &#8212; to a large congregation &#8212; my “Rain &amp;
                    River” Sermon &#8212; an old affair &#8212; for want of a better, Clarke thought
                    he wd preach in the afternoon &#8212; He preached grandly. Text &#8212; “The
                    Lord is my shepherd” &#8212; He has preached it before, but it is still fresh.
                    The Louisvillians do not know what a treasure they have in that man. For my
                    part, take him simply as a <hi rend="underline">preacher</hi>. I do not know
                    that I have ever listened to preaching so good as his. Such freshness, boldness,
                    earnestness of style, thought, delivery &#8212; It is delightful to listen to
                    him. &#8212; Such a fine union of deep, original thought with practical
                    illustration, and of a poetic imagination with the tenderest feeling &#8212; His
                        <hi rend="underline">Independence</hi> in everything he does is truly
                    refreshing. He is no formula-man. He “swallows all formulas”, as Carlyle <fw

                    such a man. I think this sojourn with him, has done me good. It ought to. He is
                    a rare genius: a noble spirit.</p>
                <p rend="text-indent:-2em;">He spoke in his sermon of the spiritual advantages of

                        the task to him. He is just the man for it. I was surprised &amp; rejoiced
                        to hear it. What a noble spirit he is! He is <hi rend="underline">all</hi>

                        He is already fitted for it. I am not. The time that <hi rend="underline"

                  University Press, 1964], 361</bibl>). This also follows the theme in “The American
               Scholar” that significant truths derive not necessarily from books but from an
               engagement with nature&#8212;“instead of Man Thinking, we have the bookworm”

                  Resartus</title> to not know thyself, but "know what thou canst work at," Carlyle
               asks a rhetorical question: “Hast thou a certain Faculty, a certain Worth, such even
               as the most have not; or art thou the completest Dullard of these modern times? Alas,
               the fearful Unbelief is unbelief in yourself; and how could I believe?” (123). The
               “skepticism” recalls Carlyle’s arguments against the “Age of Skepticism” induced by
               Voltaire, Hume, the French Revolution, materialism, and British Utilitarianism. In
               his “State of German Literature” essay, Carlyle suggests that German writers provide
               spiritual sustenance to people hampered by skepticism, which has made Europe “a scene

               charm of his imagination,” resolving to stand behind “a man whose life is holiness,

               natural and poetic.” An early version of “Heroism” was delivered as a lecture in

               I lent [Furness] my Emersonian scraps to take on with him, and it seems by sundry
               external signs upon them since they were returned to me, that they have been
               considerably thumbed and pocketed. Great men have looked upon them. The genius of a

               Mirabeau” (1838): “So blazes out, far-seen, a Man’s Life, and becomes ashes and a

               "Self-Reliance": “Travelling is a fool's paradise [...] The rage of travelling is a
               symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The

                     >Nature</hi>, for example, in the "Idealism" chapter, where</quote> the
               virtuous consider the <quote>“whole circle of persons and things, of actions and
                  events, of country and religion, not as painfully accumulated, atom after atom,
                  act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture, which God paints
                  on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of the soul”</quote>
                  (<title>CW</title>, 1:29, 36). Cranch could also be thinking of Emerson’s early
               lecture “On the Relation of Man to the Globe” (<title>Early Lectures</title>
               1:27&#8211;49), which set the groundwork for compensation as one of Emerson's
               fundamental ideas (even though the word “compensation” does not appear in the lecture
               and in <title>Nature</title>).</note>
            <note xml:id="note25">In a letter of February 9, 1839, Clarke also entertained doubts
               about “the expediency of my leaving Louisville,” adding that “I have no such serious
               purpose, but at times I am ‘exercised in mind’ about the propriety of so doing. It
               often seems to me as if some one else could do more good than I here, and I do more
               good somewhere else. I am by no means a popular preacher in this place, nor ever
               shall be ... I am extremely anxious in this matter to be guided solely by duty ...
               William Channing urged me so strongly to retain the ‘Western Messenger’ that I have
               agreed to do so till the end of the sixth number, volume vi. Then I hope they will
               take it to Cincinnati. C. P. Cranch stayed three weeks with me after I reached home,

            <note xml:id="note26">On October 14, 1837, Cranch had written to his sister Margaret
               about Georgiana Emily: “I went the other night to see Mr. Keats, an English gentleman
               residing here, and brother to Keats, the poet. He seemed to be a very intelligent and
               gentlemanly man, and has some daughters, only one of whom I saw, a young lady about
               fourteen years apparently, with face and features strongly resembling Keats, the
               poet, or that little portrait of him which you see in the volume containing his poems
               in conjunction with Coleridge and Shelley. I could scarcely keep my eyes from her
               countenance, so striking was the likeness” (<bibl>Scott, <title>Life and

            <note xml:id="note27">Dialogic artistry was a crucial aspect of transcendentalism, due
               in large part to the salon-like conversation/debating clubs such as the Semi-Colon
               club that Cranch attended (see <ref target="#note28">note 28</ref>. See Noelle A.

            <note xml:id="note28">Semi-Colon was a primarily Unitarian conversation club consisting
               mostly of writers and intellectuals. The Beecher sisters were among its members, and
               the club played a part in launching the career of Harriet Beecher Stowe (see
                  <bibl>Forrest Wilson’s <title>Crusader in Crinoline: A Life of Harriet Beecher
                     Stowe</title> [New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1941]</bibl>: 122&#8211;26).
               Semi-Colon provided intellectual stimulation for a small cohort of Boston-area
               transplants in a rugged frontier city. See <bibl>Louis Tucker, “The Semi-Colon Club
                  of Cincinnati,” <title>Ohio History</title> 73, no. 1 (1964)</bibl>. For a recent
               essay on the Semi-Colon members, women writers, and its hostesses (including a
               section on Cranch’s relation to club), see <bibl>Nicole Tonkovich’s “Writing in
                  Circles,” in <title>Nineteenth-Century Women Learn To Write</title>
                  (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1995), 149&#8211;78</bibl>. Cranch
               praised Semi-Colon for providing freedom for more advanced writers as well as
               “embolden[ing] beginners to a spontaneity of thought and style” (Library of Congress
               manuscript; quoted in Tonkovich, 152). Tonkovich also challenges the accuracy of
               Wilson’s view on the club’s responsibility for bolstering Stowe’s career.</note>
            <note xml:id="note29">“Dreams” appeared in the <bibl><title>Western Messenger</title> 6
                  (June 1839): 98&#8211;100</bibl>. Of interest is his rhetorical question,
                  <quote>“may it not be, that dreams are one way in which the spiritual gains access
                  to the spirit's ear [. . .] ?”</quote> The “imprisoned spirit” looks to the
               Imagination for spiritual answers. This may have informed Cranch’s poem “The Three
               Muses,” in which he describes a bewildered traveler's waking dream, and a muse calls
               upon <quote>“the truth sublime” of “The soul within the soul, the hidden life, / The
                  fount of dreams, the vision and the strife / Of thoughts that seized on every
                  other force, / And turned it to their own resistless course”</quote>

                  Osgood and Company, 1875], 31</bibl>). Cranch often channeled Emerson's idea in
                  <title>Nature</title> that <quote>“the world is a divine dream”</quote> (also
                  <quote>“a dream may let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred

            <note xml:id="note30">Cranch wrote to Clarke on January 22 about the party: “Last night
               I went to a Semicolon party at Mrs. Stetson’s. We had a glorious time. The pieces
               were good, and the music refreshing; and dancing&#8212;heavens! how they danced. ‘Old
               men and maidens gay’, whose heads seemed almost topsyturveyed. It was one of the most
               delightful seasons of social refreshment I ever enjoyed. A perfect inundation of
               spirits, whose merry and sparkling utterances seemed to set afloat in mere
               kindliness, the most staid and old, who at first were prone to root themselves to the
               sides of the room in their chairs. ‘Such music flows from kind hearts, in a kind
               environment of time and peace.’ ‘The poor claims of me and thee vanished.’ We were
               all as one” (MHS typescript).</note>
            <note xml:id="note31">In an undated fragment of a journal or letter, Cranch expressed
               his frustration with the “over-cautious and conservative Unitarians of Massachusetts”
               who took issue with his work at the <title>Western Messenger</title> (MHS
               typescript). He was also not afraid to poke at them: see his poem (signed “X”) in the
               May 1838 (vol. 5) issue of the <title>Western Messenger</title>&#8212; <quote>"Surely
                  our preachers should have warmth of soul, / And yet we hear of Unitarian
                  coldness&#8212; / We have our Green-wood, Furness, Burn-up, Cole, / And Flint and
                  sparks once blazed away with boldness, / And now along with names so warm and

            <note xml:id="note32">Perkins had written in a letter to a friend, just after he became

               “Cranch's ‘Journal,’” 148). His chief objective was “to form such connections with
               the poor as will enable us, in some degree at least, to withdraw them and their
               children from evil associations, and to combine immediate physical relief with
               continued moral relief; and second, to find those in need employment”

            <note xml:id="note33"><hi rend="underline">cement</hi>] Cranch may have recalled this
               metaphor from Emerson’s 1833 lecture “The Uses of Natural History,” in which he
               encourages strong minds to sympathize with all fellow beings: “Where is it these fair
               creatures (in whom an order and series is so distinctly discernable,) find their link,
               their cement, their keystone, but in the Mind of Man? It is he who marries the
               visible to the Invisible by uniting thought to Animal Organization” (<title>Early
                  Lectures</title>, 1:24). Also, he might be remembering a similar thought from
               “Water,” in which Emerson speaks of the friend who “is present in every function of
               life, grows in the vegetable, is a cement, and an engineer, and an architect, in
               inanimate nature” (<title>Early Lectures</title>, 1:51).</note>
            <note xml:id="note34">On December 7, 1838, Thomas Butler fatally stabbed a clerk named
               James T. White with a Bowie knife in "a house of ill fame" in Cincinnati
                  (<title>Cincinnati Whig</title>, December 10, 1838). The <title>Whig</title>
               reported that "some disturbance took place in an upper room of the establishment,
               (but with which Mr. White had nothing to do,) which attracted the notice of Butler,
               who immediately started for the scene of the riot. In going up stairs, he met Mr.
               White coming down, and instantly gave him two fatal stabs in the region of the heart,
               and, (so far as is known,) without the slightest provocation. ... Butler made his
               escape." The mayor of Cincinnati offered a $250 reward for his capture. He was
               captured in late December and returned to his native city of Jeffersonville, Indiana,
               according to a Cincinnati correspondent's report in the January 3, 1839,
                  <title>Scioto Gazette</title> (Chillicothe, Ohio). Butler's trial ended on January
               22 with a guilty verdict of second-degree murder.</note>

                  <title>Nature</title>, William Henry Furness devotes a chapter to the miracles,
               arguing that the word comes from the Latin <hi rend="italic">miraculum</hi>, meaning
               “wonder,” and that Jesus’s miracles were wonders of “moral elevation” rather than

                  Carey, Lea and Blanchard, 1836], 145&#8211;46</bibl>). He also quotes William
               Ellery Channing’s remarks that God’s purpose is to establish the “order of Nature,”
               “and miracles, instead of warring against, would concur with nature” (147&#8211;48).

               common sense and eclecticism of Cousin and Jouffroy, yet Emerson soon wrote in his
               journal that he found "nothing of worth in the accomplished Cousin &amp; the mild
               Jouffroy." See <bibl>Philip F. Gura, <title>American Transcendentalism: A

               friends for his musical as for his conversational abilities, once complained about
               the tediousness in staying in one place, day after day, <quote>"'as idle as a painted
                  ship upon a painted ocean.’ I should think it was next to being becalmed at sea.
                  The good folks here seem to have discovered my musical propensities and
                  weaknessess, and I am accordingly made use of as unceremoniously as if I were a
                  poor passive pitchpipe for everybody to sound. I fear my consenting to sing that
                  everlasting ‘Schoolmaster’ has proved the father of many future bores on my part.
                  Two or three times already, have I bawled it out to the exercise of many
                  cachinnatory muscles in the auditors thereof. Some of my German songs also, I have
                  attempted. I flute all alone as yet, though I found a fine flute at Mr.

                  not have time. Next Sunday I intend to preach in Phila spend a few days in New

               unpublished commonplace book, ca. 1872&#8211;79, pp. 191&#8211;93, in which he
               laments his <quote>“misfortune (as regards worldly &amp; pecuniary success) to have

               recalled this time in more detail: <quote>"In 1839 I preached a sermon in Dr.

                  spiritual. He that loseth life shall find it. The lower life is lost that the
                  higher may survive. I remember preaching it once at the Thursday lecture in
                  Boston, when Mr. Emerson was one of my hearers, and that he was interested in it.
                  The MS. was lost&#8212;burnt up with all my old sermons in the fire that destroyed
                  the old De Windt homestead in 1862, with all my books and my letters, and other

                <p>Albeit I wrote the last letter which passed between us, my pen yearneth to speak
                    to thee again. I know that my poor epistles scarce deserve the happiness of
                    being replied to, by such as thine&#8212;and perhaps in the multitude of
                    cares&#8212;amid sermons and editorials, and multifarious readings and writings
                    you hardly find time to bestow so much of yourself upon your correspondents as
                    they could desire. Yet, verily, this shall not deter me from communing with
                    thee, my friend; this is a pleasure I can not easily relinquish. Having had one
                    sip of the fountain, I would not willingly be removed from it. Send forth,
                    therefore, I beseech thee, a few drops of thy refreshing streams. My heart will
                    bless you for it, if my poor wits can not adequately repay you.</p>
                <p>I have taken up my abode you perceive in this Philadelphia, and am minister to
                    the new society at the “Northern Liberties” for some weeks. They are at present
                    a feeble folk like the conies, and poor in this world’s goods; but I trust they
                    may increase, and their latter end be respectable. I should like it right well,
                    could I be the means of building up a church among them. Time will show what can
                    be done. I have been supplying Mr. Furness’ pulpit a few Sundays, while he went
                    northward. By the way, I lent him my Emersonian scraps [sketches] to take on
                    with him, and it seems by sundry external signs upon them since they were
                    returned to me, that they have been considerably thumbed and pocketed. Great men
                    have looked upon them. The genius of a Dewey and a Channing hath stopped to
                    smile condescendingly on them. Our fame, friend, groweth. It hath been budding
                    with the spring. We are linked in celebrity, and thus will descend to posterity
                    as the immortal illustrators of the great Transcendentalist! When all trades
                    fail, let us take to caricaturing. We have humors that way. I did not, by the
                    way, hear the echo of your laugh over the last scraps I sent you from
                    Washington. Pray tell me if you received them safe out of the vulgar hands of
                    the men of the post office. I would not have these sacred mysteries bared to
                    common daylight and to uninitiated and vulgar risibilities. Pray tell me that
                    you received them. I heard in fancy your laugh for a week. Do write that laugh
                    on paper, and send us a scrap of your own.</p>
                <p>O my brother, we need your poetic faculty to quicken us in this life. My wits
                    have brought forth little but thorns and weeds since thy rain and sunshine were
                    withdrawn. True, when I was at home, the quiet atmosphere of that loved spot,
                    backed by the influences of the opening spring, and the bees and blossoms, did
                    call forth some fruit&#8212;such as it was. And I did commence a Spenserian
                    stanza poem which I shall probably never complete. I wrote near forty stanzas.
                    It is a love tale, thus far. But I got dissatisfied with it. I followed my own
                    experience too closely. Besides, it does not look ministerial. Should I publish,
                    what would the world say, etc., etc.&#8212;comes into my mind. What have I to do
                    with writing and publishing such stuff?</p>
                <p>I perceive you are relieved of the immediate care of the “Messenger”. I wish you
                    joy. I hope Channing will not mix in too much abolitionism. Look out for
                    southern subscribers, if you don’t take care.</p>
                <p>I saw young Huidekoper a week ago, who was just about embarking for Europe.
                    Chandler Robbins also I met in New York just before he sailed. I had a good time
                    in New York at the dedication of Dewey’s church. I don’t like the name&#8212;do
                    you? He preached a grand sermon though. And Fanny Parkman who seems to be
                    midwife general to all the churches which are legitimate, made an excellent
                    dedicatory prayer.</p>
                <p>But now, no more. Tempus est stopendi. Windum up est. Write to us if we have any
                    place in your memory. Remember me to each and all of my good Louisville friends.
                    I remember them all with interest.</p>
                <p>Ever your friend and brother, C. P. C. </p>
