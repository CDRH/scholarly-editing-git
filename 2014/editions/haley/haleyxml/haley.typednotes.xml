            <note type="headnote"> Note: Below are transcriptions and images of typed notes that
                Alex Haley compiled during his work on <emph>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</emph>.
                During the year and a half that Haley conducted interviews to gain information for
                the book, he would jot down notes on scrap paper, collect the scribbles, transcribe
                them into typed and written notes, and eventually piece together the notes to write
                    <emph>The Autobiography</emph>. From the contents, it seems that Haley wrote
                this set of notecards during interviews conducted the last six to twelve months of
                Malcolm X's life. There is no indication that scholars are aware of this small
                holding of notecards, which might prove to be important clues to the production of
                    <emph>The Autobiography.</emph> The notecards are also representations of the
                complicated relationship between Haley and X, an often debated issue in scholarly
                circles. The notecards from which these materials are transcribed are housed in the
                Alex Haley Papers held by Cushing Library, Special Collections, at Texas A&amp;M
                University. </note>

                <p> The most instantly angry I ever saw Malcolm X. was one day we were in his car
                    driving in Harlem, and at 136th Street between Lenox and 7th Avenues he saw a

                <note xml:id="note39">Haley recounts the story of "how Malcolm X never lost his
                    racial perspective," noting that X stated that a group of children newly arrived
                    to the United States would soon use their "first English

                <note xml:id="note40">The <emph>Saturday Evening Post</emph> published a cover story
                    on Malcolm X on September 12, 1964. Haley was interviewed by the magazine and
                    the <emph>SEP</emph> "flew photographer John Launois to Cairo to locate Malcolm
                    X and photograph him in color" (<emph>The Autobiography</emph>, 418). When X
                    received a copy of the article from Haley he was furious. The editorial
                    negatively compared X to King: "If Malcolm X were not a Negro, his
                    autobiography would be little more than a journal of abnormal psychology, the
                    story of a burglar, dope pusher, addict and jailbird--with a family history of
                    insanity--who acquires messianic delusions and sets forth to preach an
                    upside-down religion of 'brotherly' hatred." ("The Lesson of Malcolm X,"
                        <emph>Saturday Evening Post,</emph> September 12, 1964, 84). Haley reports
                    that X continued to be upset about the editorial, railing against it months
                    later (<emph>The Autobiography</emph>, 422). </note>
                <note xml:id="note41">Malcolm X noted that "I do believe that I have fought the best
                    that I knew how, and the best that I could, with the shortcomings that I have
