            <note type="headnote"> Note: Below are transcriptions and images of handwritten notes
                that Alex Haley compiled during his work on <emph>The Autobiography of Malcolm
                    X</emph>. During the year and a half that Haley conducted interviews to gain
                information for the book, he would jot down notes on scrap paper, collect the
                scribbles, transcribe them into typed and written notes, and eventually piece
                together the notes to write <emph>The Autobiography</emph>. From the contents, it
                seems that Haley wrote this set of notecards during interviews conducted the last
                six to twelve months of Malcolm X's life. There is no indication that scholars are
                aware of this small holding of notecards, which might prove to be important clues to
                the production of <emph>The Autobiography.</emph> The notecards are also
                representations of the complicated relationship between Haley and X, an
                often-debated issue in scholarly circles. The notecards from which these materials
                are transcribed are housed in the Alex Haley Papers held by Cushing Library, Special
                Collections, at Texas A&amp;M University. </note>
