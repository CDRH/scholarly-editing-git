it was the middle of January in the  
present year that I first looked up and saw the  
mark on the wall. In order to fix a date it is  
necessary to remember what one saw. So now I  
think of the fire; the steady film of yellow light  
upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums 
in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. 
Yes, it must have been the winter time,  
and we had just finished our tea, for I remember 
that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked  
up and saw the mark on the wall for the first  
time. I looked up through the smoke of my  
cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon  
the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson 
flag flapping from the castle tower came  
into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of  
red knights riding up the side of the black rock.  
Rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted 
the fancy, for it is an old fancy, an 
automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The 
mark was a small round mark, black upon the 
white wall, about six or seven inches above the 
mantelpiece.</p>
<p>
How readily our thoughts swarm upon a new 
object, lifting it a little way, as ants carry a 
blade of straw so feverishly, and then leave <app><rdg wit="#ho17" type="punctuation">it. . . . .</rdg>

</app> If that mark was made by a nail, it can't 
have been for a picture, it must have been for a 
miniature&#8212;the miniature of a lady with white 
powdered curls, powder-dusted cheeks, and lips 
like red carnations. A fraud of course, for the 
people who had this house before us would have 
chosen pictures in that way&#8212;an old picture for 
an old room. That is the sort of people they 
were&#8212;very interesting people, and I think of 
them so often, in such queer places, because one 
will never see them again, never know what 
happened

  <note type="annotation"><p>These two sentences were excised from the versions after 1919 and replaced simply with the word “they.” This description could refer to the previous owners of Asheham or Hogarth House, the Woolfs’ primary residences in this period. However, Woolf may have elected to remove these lines because they referred specifically to people in her life, especially since this story was originally released to a small, private audience. They may have been recognizable to others in Woolf’s circle and the comments are not particularly flattering. The tone is one of mild condescension: Woolf describes the man as a commercial artist, presumably middle class, while the woman is marked as either middle class or at least unfashionable with her flannel collar. Celia Marshik notes the importance of clothing as a social signifier in Woolf’s era in her analysis of the Mackintosh coat in modernist literature as “more and more people came to appreciate the power of clothing (whether fashionable or practical) to shape self-presentation and thus to assert a particular social significance and role.”<note type="editorial">Celia Marshik, “The Modern(ist) Mackintosh,” <hi rend="italic">Modernism/modernity</hi> 19 no. 1 (January 2012): 44.</note> In <hi rend="italic">To the Lighthouse</hi>, this awareness is evident in Charles Tansley’s reaction to Lily Briscoe’s judgmental eye. According to Emily Blair, Lily’s insincerity “causes Charles Tansley to feel his class: ‘his old flannel trousers,’ his roughness, and his isolation from the social manner at the dinner.”<note type="editorial">Emily Blair, <hi rend="italic">Virginia Woolf and the Nineteenth-Century Domestic Novel</hi> (Albany: State University of New York, 2007), 206.</note> His clothing is intertwined with his class and marks him as separate from the group. In a similar manner, the specific reference to the flannel collar marks this woman as apart from the dominant, fashionable, social group. </p>

<p>The excision also comes at a time when the Hogarth Press was becoming a more professional and at the same time more public project. Leonard claims that it was only in 1920 that he and Virginia conceptualized the Hogarth Press as a professional enterprise. Before that, the “Hogarth Press was a hobby, and the hobby consisted in the printing which we did in our spare time in the afternoons.”<note type="editorial">Leonard Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Downhill All the Way</hi> (New York: Harcourt Brace and Co., 1967), 66.</note> Clive Bell recalls that Virginia’s diary and letter writing could often be (sometimes inaccurately) critical of people she knew or encountered. Bell remembers that when Hogarth published extracts from Virginia’s diary, “The editor, himself, very properly cut out a number of passages which were much too personal, not to say libelous, to be published while the victims were alive.”<note type="editorial"><!--fixed-->Clive Bell, “A Genius Who Worked Magic,” <hi rend="italic">in Virginia Woolf: Interviews and Recollections</hi>, edited by J. H. Stape (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995), 96.</note> This excision may reflect a similar anxiety over libel or simply a remark that might hit too close to home. </p>

because they wanted to change their style of 
furniture, so he said, and he was in process of 
saying that in his opinion art should have ideas 
behind it when we were torn asunder, as one is 
torn from the old lady about to pour out tea and 
the young man about to hit the tennis ball in the 
back garden of the suburban villa as one rushes 
past in the train. </p>

    <note type ="annotation"><p>E. M. Forster in his review [July 1919] of “The Mark on the Wall” claims that “there is, as Mrs. Woolf sadly points out, a moral of a sort; she is a poor housekeeper, or the mark would not be there.”<note type="editorial">E. M. Forster, “Visions,” in <hi rend="italic">Virginia Woolf: The Critical Heritage</hi>, edited by Robin Majumdar and Allen McLaurin (London and Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1975), 69.</note> This passage, excised from the 1921 and 1944 editions of “The Mark on the Wall,” suggests a number of intriguing possibilities regarding Virginia Woolf’s relationship to servants. Heather Levy argues that the elision of these fourteen sentences reveals that “the narrator eagerly participates in constructing an hermetically sealed space in the final version of the short story which silences the voices of working class women and those defined as racial outsiders by history.”<note type="editorial">Heather Levy, <hi rend="italic">The Servants of Desire in Virginia Woolf’s Shorter Fiction</hi>, vol. 8 of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Twentieth-Century British Literature</hi>, edited by Karen Radell (New York: Peter Lang, 2010), 78.</note> For Levy, Woolf trades in the “upper middle class habit of constructing working class women as shadows.”<note type="editorial">Levy, <hi rend="italic">Servants</hi>, 79.</note> Levy also theorizes that the passage was excised because of Leonard’s growing commitment to British socialism, repeating a trope in Woolf criticism that Virginia operated in the sphere of ivory-tower aestheticism while Leonard worked in the practical, political sphere. Scholars such as Helen Southworth have begun to complicate and question this narrative. Attending to the quotidian functions of the Hogarth Press, Southworth argues that this Virginia/Leonard binary is reductive, illustrating that “the Hogarth Press provided Leonard and Virginia Woolf an opportunity to bridge ‘the gulf’ separating an old world ‘divided by hedges’ from a new ‘world without classes and towers.’”<note type="editorial">Helen Southworth, “‘Going Over’: The Woolfs, the Hogarth Press, and Working-Class Voices,” in <hi rend="italic">Leonard and Virginia Woolf, the Hogarth Press, and the Networks of Modernism</hi>, edited by Helen Southworth (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), 206.</note></p>
<p>Reading Virginia’s diaries and letters reveals a complex relationship to servants, a topic dealt with at length by Allison Light in her <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Woolf and the Servants</hi>. Woolf records a variety of interactions between herself and the servants, and these interactions reveal that she was certainly aware of and interested in the daily lives of servants. There are some major interactions mentioned in the diaries with Lily, Lizzie, Maud, and Lottie. Lily was a parlormaid who had worked for the Woolfs at Asheham in 1914 when she had had a baby out of wedlock. Virginia gave her a reference to work with Mrs. Hallett, and her first diary entries display a mixture of empathy and pity toward Lily as she faces new accusations from Mrs. Hallett. Woolf writes on January 1, “Mrs H. is an old angry woman, meticulous, indeed as we knew tyrannical, about her servants; &amp; Lily honestly meant no wrong.”<note type="editorial">Virginia Woolf, <hi rend="italic">The Diary of Virginia Woolf</hi>, edited by Anne Bell (London: Hogarth Press, 1977), 1:3.</note> Later, when Lily is dismissed by Mrs. Hallett for hiding soldiers in the pantry, Woolf, somewhat condescendingly, empathizes with her erstwhile servant and continues to assist her:
<q rend="block">	Lily’s letter continues the story of the hidden soldier. It brings her very clearly before me, with her charming, stupid, doglike eyes, quite incapable of hurting a fly or thinking a coarse thought, &amp; yet bound eternally to suffer for the sins of stronger characters. In this case, she was at the mercy of a parlourmaid, who invited the soldiers, &amp; Lily had neither the strength of mind to be rude to them when they came, nor to ‘tell tales of a fellow servant’. ‘I would rather do anything than that’&#8212;&amp; that, I imagine, was how she had her baby too. Anyhow, I have ‘spoken’ for her again, &amp; she has promised to have no more to do with soldiers.<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:8.</note> </q> 
When the Woolfs lived at Mrs. Le Grys’s in Richmond, Woolf records that the maid Lizzie was dangerously incompetent. On two occasions, Woolf writes that Lizzie started fires and once “smashed two very nice bits of china for us.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:15.</note> Lizzie’s replacement, Maud, is described as mentally unstable:
<q rend="block">	But the fact of the day for me has been a vague kind of discomfort, caused by the eccentric character of the new servant Maud. When one speaks to her, she stops dead &amp; looks at the ceiling. She bursts into the room ‘just to see if you are there’. She is an angular woman of about 40, who never stays long in any place. I believe she lives in dread of something. She puts down plates with a start. Mrs Le Grys says that she herself is going mad, with Maud’s peculiarities. She has just announced that she is the daughter of a Colonel. I am sure her brain is full of illusions, poor creature; &amp; I shouldn’t be surprised at anything. The only question is, how she contrives to exist.<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:31.</note></q>
Woolf’s description of Lottie reveals a bit more haughtiness toward her servants. Virginia consistently exhibited some concern and regard for her servants, but she seems to have run out of patience with Lottie, a housemaid she had hired in 1916 on the recommendation of Roger Fry: 
<q rend="block">	By rights Lottie should have a whole chapter to herself at this point; but to live through those things is unpleasant enough without reviving them here. At this moment owing to what she overheard L. say to me before breakfast, I am uncertain whether we have 2 servants or not, &amp; to tell the truth, completely indifferent, such is the relief of being without them for a fortnight. Considering their unimportance they must be compared to flies in the eye for the discomfort they can produce in spite of being so small. But let us change the subject.<note type="editorial"> V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:197.</note></q>  
Certainly, this letter regarding Lottie betrays a certain aristocratic disdain for the servant, but it remains unclear whether this was directed at Lottie herself or her servants more generally. The passage excised from <hi rend="italic">Monday or Tuesday</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A Haunted House</hi> suggests an ominous quality to the housekeeper, an authoritative accusatory profile with bourgeois pretensions. However, in his autobiography, <hi rend="italic">Downhill All the Way</hi>, Leonard remembers that although Virginia was “the least political animal that has lived since Aristotle invented the definition,” she was “intensely interested in things, peoples, and events, and, as her new books show, highly sensitive to the atmosphere which surrounded her.”<note type="editorial">L. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Downhill</hi>, 27.</note> Perhaps Virginia’s reactions to her servants were predicated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>An alternative theory for the excision, which Levy does not consider, is that the housekeeper, “with a profile like a police-man,” was an actual person the Woolfs knew and that the passage was excised from the 1921 version of “The Mark on the Wall” because the press was becoming “professional.” Leonard claims that it was only in 1920 that he and Virginia conceptualized the Hogarth Press as a professional enterprise. Before that, the “Hogarth Press was a hobby, and the hobby consisted in the printing which we did in our spare time in the afternoons.”<note type="editorial">L. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Downhill</hi>, 66.</note> Clive Bell recalls that Virginia’s diary and letter writing could often be (sometimes inaccurately) critical of people she knew or encountered. Bell remembers that, when Hogarth published extracts from Virginia’s diary, “The editor, himself, very properly cut out a number of passages which were much too personal, not to say libelous, to be published while the victims were alive.”<note type="editorial">Bell, “Genius,” 96.</note> 
Perhaps the housekeeper cut from <hi rend="italic">Monday or Tuesday</hi> represented a real person who had worked for the Woolfs, and after 1920 the image was deemed inappropriate. What is clear is that Woolf’s relationship to her servants is complex and ambiguous, and scholars who accuse Woolf of elitism perhaps miss the point.</p></note>

  <note type="annotation">
<p>“Nature" is capitalized in the earlier British versions of the story. The lowercase letters in the 1945 Hogarth edition and both Harcourt versions deemphasize the personification of nature. The emphasis on nature in the earlier versions is consistent with Woolf’s preoccupation with nature during that time. She had begun experiencing headaches in March 1915 and quickly slipped into mental illness during which she was placed under constant supervision for months. Her diaries were interrupted by this sustained illness and were not resumed until 1917. During this period, Virginia spent much of her recovery visiting Asheham House in Sussex. Hogarth Press published <hi rend="italic">Publication No. 1 Two Stories</hi> in July 1917. When the diary resumes at Asheham in August after a two-year hiatus, her journal entries had changed from the expansive descriptions of everyday life common to the previous diaries to taciturn discussions of weather and nature. The early entries in the Asheham diary, written during summer 1917, focus almost exclusively on natural phenomena (with some war details), suggesting that Woolf’s engagement with nature was salutary for her convalescence. However, even her descriptions of nature seem shadowed by her recent illness. For example, on Sunday, August 19, 1917, Woolf discovered a caterpillar she had noticed a week earlier. Virginia seems haunted by its transformation: “Sat in the hollow; &amp; found the caterpillar, now becoming a Chrysalis, wh. I saw the other day. A horrid sight: head turning from side to side, tail paralysed; brown colour, purple spots just visible; like a snake in movement. No mushrooms.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:43.</note> Other letters reveal striking juxtapositions of impressions: “Trees an ugly leaden colour outside, as if shriveled, flowers beaten down &amp; brown; butterflies scarcely flying . . . Lovely night again. A great white owl, looking like a sea gull, sat on the rail, &amp; flew about. Mushrooms started on my patch. L. took wasps.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:47.</note> Some of her encounters with nature are described in beautiful detail: “Another fine morning. I walked, &amp; L. did the garden. I saw a clouded yellow [<hi rend="italic">Colias edusa</hi>] on the top&#8212;a very deep yellow the first for a long time. Clouds brewed over the sea, &amp; it began to rain at tea; then great thunder claps, &amp; lightning.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:48.</note> In October, Virginia describes the purchase of paper and pens as “the happiest day that exists for me.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, 1:55.</note> Whether or not her use of the capital letter “N” in the early versions of “The Mark on the Wall” reflects her exploration of nature as a salve for mental turmoil, comparing the different versions raises interesting questions regarding her experience of (N)ature.</p>

</app> once more at her old game of 
self-preservation. This train of thought, she 
perceives, is threatening mere waste of energy, 
even some collision with reality, for who will 
ever be able to lift a finger against Whitaker's 
Table of Precedency? The Archbishop of Canterbury 
is followed by the Lord High Chancellor; 
the Lord High Chancellor is followed by 
the Archbishop of York. Everybody follows 
somebody, such is the philosophy of Whitaker; 
and the great thing is to know who follows  
whom. Whitaker knows, and let that, so Nature 
counsels, comfort you, instead of enraging 
you; and if you can't be comforted, if you must 
shatter this hour of peace, think of the mark on 
the wall.</p>
<p>I understand Nature's game&#8212;her prompting 
to take action as a way of ending any thought 
that threatens to excite or to pain. Hence, I

  <note type="annotation"><p>The earliest publication of the story&#8212;from the Hogarth edition of <hi rend="italic">Two Stories</hi>in 1917&#8212;represents the least standardized version in terms of punctuation, but it also allows us to better understand the pacing of the dialogue in the passage. For instance, after the second person in the story announces: “Though it’s no good, buying newspapers,” Woolf uses not a standard ellipsis but six consecutive and unspaced periods before the character continues with “Nothing ever happens.”<note type="editorial">Virginia Woolf, “The Mark on the Wall,” in <hi rend="italic">Two Stories</hi> (Richmond: Hogarth Press, 1917), 31.</note> This unusual punctuation suggests a longer pause than the other, more conventional, ellipses that she utilizes in the passages. Further, in its nonstandard use, the extended ellipsis also hints at the kind of repression in which the entire story participates. Here, the oddly long string of periods draws attention to all that is deliberately avoided in the statement. That is, in 1917, at the height of World War I, much more than “nothing” is happening. In her next revision of the story for the 1919 edition of <hi rend="italic">The Mark on the Wall</hi> by Hogarth following the close of the war, Woolf revises the punctuation into the more standard form of a period followed by an ellipsis&#8212;all evenly spaced apart.

    <note type="annotation"><p>In the 1917 version, the text reads: “Curse this war ! God damn this war !...All the same, I don't see why we should have a snail on our wall” with a the period falling outside the quotation marks in the British style. Also one notes the lack of spacing between the second exclamation point and the ellipsis that follows. Again, this may have been a typographical decision, which lends the text a kind of chaotic or confused disposition. In the 1919 and 1921 Hogarth versions, the punctuation is spaced apart, and the final period is moved before the terminal quotation mark&#8212;an Americanization. Woolf changes another bit of punctuation in the passage in the 1921 edition of <hi rend="italic">Monday or Tuesday</hi> published by Harcourt, which reads: “Curse this war; God damn this war! . . . All the same, I don't see why we should have a snail on our wall.”<note type="editorial">Virginia Woolf, “The Mark on the Wall,” in <hi rend="italic">Monday or Tuesday</hi> (New York: Harcourt Brace and Co., 1921), 116.</note> The change is simple but significant. Following the first exclamation of “Curse this war,” she substitutes a semicolon for the original exclamation point. Thus, in the earliest versions&#8212;1917, 1919, and the Hogarth 1921&#8212;the passage has more emotional intensity. Indeed, the speaker is in effect shouting profanity at the daydreaming woman. Thus, a few years after the war has ceased, Woolf can&#8212;at least in part&#8212;subdue the aggressiveness of the man’s expostulation.</p></note>

  <note type="annotation"><p>The final paragraph, comprised of two brief sentences, returns to the narrator’s point of view. In the 1917 publication, the passage reads: “Ah, the mark on the wall! For it was a snail.”<note type="editorial">V. Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Two Stories</hi>, 31.</note>  The sentences are concise and lack the anger and intensity present in the previous lines cursing the war. These final two sentences refuse to acknowledge the mention of the war and are far milder in their tone. Woolf made only one change to the final paragraph by removing “for” at the beginning of the final sentence so that every version from 1919 on reads: “Ah, the mark on the wall! It was a snail.”<note type="editorial">Virginia Woolf, <hi rend="italic">The Mark on the Wall</hi> (Richmond: Hogarth Press, 1919), 10.</note> It is a significant omission, particularly given that it is the only change to the wording of the passage. First, the removal of the preposition makes the last sentence simpler and more succinct. It also disconnects the sentence from the previous, since, if the second sentence begins with such a preposition, it is, in a sense, a dependent clause. Here the sentence stands alone. Indeed, when one reaches the final passage, the sentence is so simple and direct, an assertion of what this story has been about, that the reader could easily miss the brief mention of the calamitous war that surrounds the quiet household. That is, the grammatical simplification of the final two sentences in the later version, and their disconnection from the previous sentences, might be read as mirroring the tactic of avoiding and repressing knowledge of the war that the narrator relies on throughout the text.</p>
