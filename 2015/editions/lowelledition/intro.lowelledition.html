                <div class="p">On August 27, 1847, a poem appeared in the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em> under the headline "LATE FROM MEXICO," situating
                    it as news from the still-raging US-Mexico War. An editorial note stated that
                    the versified letter "is certainly the most valuable document we have yet
                    received from the seat of war." Sub-headed "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN
                    SALTILLO," the poem unmasks the contradictions between recruiting rhetoric and
                    the actual war, a typical subject in similar "letters from the front" then
                    popular in newspapers. But "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" was not a real
                    letter; rather, it was one of nine protest poems written pseudonymously by James
                    Russell Lowell (in the guise of poet-farmer Hosea Biglow) between 1846-48 that
                    satirized the war. Each poem was printed initially in either the <em>Boston Courier</em> or the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em>, and each was reprinted widely across the nation.
                    Eventually, Lowell collected these poems into book form in 1848. This digital
                    edition offers a comparison of changes in orthography and punctuation as the
                    dialect poem migrated from reprint to reprint, but, more importantly, it
                    situates the poem within the context of surrounding newspaper articles.
                    Appearing next to news of the events it targets, Lowell's satire both comments
                    on that news and re-presents it through poetry. As this digital edition
                    demonstrates, the meaning of the poem shifts as its news context shifts from
                    rival northeastern reform newspapers to a cosmopolitan periodical focused on
                    international affairs, to a Democratic newspaper on the Texas frontier, to a
                    Whig newspaper in a small New Hampshire town, then in its dramatically revised
                    book form, and, ultimately, to a Pennsylvanian newspaper's remix of that book
                    edition. This digital edition of "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" is thus
                    not just a study of textual variants but also a story about editors and their
                    choices. This edition of Lowell's poem raises some important larger questions
                    about scholarly editing, in particular, what does it mean to create a digital
                    scholarly edition of a newspaper?</div>
                <div class="p">Lowell's series of poems protesting the war is "ranked high as a classic of
                    American political satire" and is "perhaps the US-Mexico War text that is most
                    familiar to scholars today."<a href="#note1" name="ref1"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span></a> Of the nine Biglow poems, we chose to present "LETTER FROM A
                    VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" for several reasons. First, unlike several other Biglow
                    poems, the poem features interplay between all three of Lowell's main satiric
                    characters: the Massachusetts farmer-poet Hosea Biglow, in whose dialect verse
                    all the poems appear; his parson, editor, and literary patron Homer Wilbur, who
                    occasionally introduced these pieces and is referred to often; and Biglow's
                    friend Birdofredum Sawin, whose letters from the front in Mexico Biglow often
                    transcribed into verse. Second, the poem's persistent allusions to contemporary
                    people, perspectives, and events offer useful historical insight but also
                    require contextualizing annotations for the twenty-first-century reader. Third,
                    more than any other Biglow poem, the "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN
                    SALTILLO"&#x2013;in its title, format, and content&#x2013; is presented as a
                    firsthand account from the seat of war and is therefore offered (and treated by
                    editors) as, to a certain extent, news, thus revealing the blurriness of lines
                    between literature and news in mid-nineteenth-century periodicals. Our edition
                    seeks to recreate the multiple contexts in which Lowell's very popular poem was
                    situated and read in newspapers.</div>
                <div class="p">As Kevin G. Barnhurst and John Nerone have argued, "Readers do not read bits of
                    text and pictures. What they read is the paper, the tangible object as a whole.
                    They enter the news environment and interact with its surface textures and
                    deeper shapes. Readers don't read the news; they swim in it."<a href="#note2" name="ref2"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span></a> In viewing
                    the images that depict "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" on a full page of
                    newsprint alongside other stories about the war, readers of this digital edition
                    temporarily "enter the news environment." When the reader considers all six
                    newspaper reprints presented in this variorum, a story emerges about the power
                    of editors to shape readers' reception of literature as well as news. Editors,
                    in making decisions about the form of a newspaper issue&#x2013;i.e. which stories
                    to reprint from other sources, whether and how to attribute them, what topical
                    heads to use, layout, order, etc.&#x2013;shape the "meaning making" of the
                    content represented on those pages. Again according to Barnhurst and Nerone,
                    "Once readers enter the newspaper, they continue to make choices, but the form
                    imposes tacit rules that allow from certain reading practices and work against
                    others. . . . the form of news constructs the audience's field of vision."<a href="#note3" name="ref3"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span></a>
                    In an era that featured rampant reprinting of stories from other papers,
                    newspapers differed not so much in the specific news items they presented as in
                    how they presented them. This edition highlights such re-presentations by
                    identifying the different editorial uses to which one very timely and political
                    poem was put over an eighteen-month span.</div>
            
            
                <h2>Hosea Biglow and the Culture of Reprinting</h2>
                <div class="p">The poem in the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> was itself
                    reprinted from the <em>Boston Courier</em>, and was reprinted many
                    times in other newspapers and periodicals across the country.<a href="#note4" name="ref4"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span></a> According to Lowell, his Biglow poems
                    were "copied everywhere," and he "saw them pinned up in workshops" and "heard
                    them quoted, and their authorship debated."<a href="#note5" name="ref5"><span class="noteRef">[5]</span></a> Reviews of the 1848 book edition also tended
                    to mention the Biglow poems' previous popularity and wide circulation in the
                    press. <em>Holden's Review</em> in early 1849 claimed the poems
                    "have been copied in every paper of the Union, from Maine to Texas, and . . .
                    have been almost as extensively copied into English periodicals"; the <em>Literary World</em> referred to the poems as "known to the
                    people of the North through the Boston newspapers"; and <em>Harbinger Review</em> in its review of the book claimed that the poems, "as
                    they first came long detached in newspapers had not a little influence in
                    bringing Massachusetts and the North upon their feet, to take the moral ground,
                    amid wicked political party issues."<a href="#note6" name="ref6"><span class="noteRef">[6]</span></a> Indeed, the poems were written and disseminated during a time
                    when a "culture of reprinting" prevailed in the United States.<a href="#note7" name="ref7"><span class="noteRef">[7]</span></a> Postal rates for newspapers (the "mammoth
                    weeklies" excepted) remained, even after the Postal Reform Act of 1845, at 1792
                    levels of a maximum of 1.5 cents for delivery anywhere in the country.
                    Additionally, the 1845 act stipulated that newspapers garnered free postage when
                    delivered within 30 miles of the place of publication. Free exchange of
                    newspapers among editors remained in place.<a href="#note8" name="ref8"><span class="noteRef">[8]</span></a> By one estimate, news accounted for approximately 95 percent of
                    the total weight of US mail by the 1830s.<a href="#note9" name="ref9"><span class="noteRef">[9]</span></a> This statistic reveals
                    the intensity of circulating news in the antebellum United States. As a result,
                    newspapers in the era of the partisan press tended to be amalgams of other
                    newspapers, "all filtered through the editor's voice."<a href="#note10" name="ref10"><span class="noteRef">[10]</span></a> This would soon
                    change as use of the electric telegraph&#x2013;patented in 1837 by Samuel
                    Morse&#x2013;led to the advent of wire services. This shift began during the
                    US-Mexico War but was not particularly widespread at the time of Lowell's
                    writing.</div>
                <div class="p">This culture of reprinting, of course, gave Lowell's poems a much wider audience
                    than they would otherwise have. Lowell pointed out in a letter to Mary Peabody
                    (wife of transcendentalist and education reformer Horace Mann) that "M<span class="superscript">r</span> Biglow has a thousand readers for my one, &amp;
                    that he has raised the laugh at War &amp; Slavery &amp; Doughfaces to some
                        purpose."<a href="#note11" name="ref11"><span class="noteRef">[11]</span></a> In fact,
                    without editors' exchanges, his work from the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em> might not have reached Southern readers at all.
                    In a move emblematic of the power of postal workers as censors, a Baltimore mail
                    clerk in 1843 tore up a copy of the <em>National Anti-Slavery
                        Standard</em> in front of its subscriber, saying, "I can't pass this."
                    Postmasters at this time often served a surveillance function, noting who took
                    in abolitionist papers, and they had government support: as president, Andrew
                    Jackson proposed that postal records be published to identify Americans
                    subscribing to "subversive" papers.<a href="#note12" name="ref12"><span class="noteRef">[12]</span></a> But Lowell's anti-slavery
                    poems did make it into Southern papers (though stripped of their radicalism),
                    thanks in part to the vast network of circulating newspapers and editorial
                    reprinting.</div>
                <div class="p">Lowell certainly recognized the power of reprinting and encouraged it. After
                    publishing his first Biglow poem in the <em>Boston Courier</em> in
                    1846, Lowell wrote to Sydney H. Gay, editor of the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em> (where Lowell had recently signed on as
                    Corresponding Editor), "You will find a squib of mine in this week's <em>Courier</em>. I wish it to continue anonymous, for I wish
                    Slavery to think it has as many enemies as possible. . . . I suppose you will
                    copy it, and, if so, I wish you would correct a misprint or two."<a href="#note13" name="ref13"><span class="noteRef">[13]</span></a> Here Lowell
                    encourages Gay to reprint his Biglow poem, acknowledges the power of anonymity
                    in a publishing environment where his byline and initials commonly appear
                    underneath anti-slavery essays, and recognizes, cheerfully enough, the
                    instability of a reprinted text. Lowell was also intensely aware of the
                    importance of timeliness to the reception of his Biglow satires. In a letter to
                    Gay on April 27, 1848, Lowell enclosed two poems and wrote, "Both will keep a
                    week, I think."<a href="#note14" name="ref14"><span class="noteRef">[14]</span></a> Similarly, in
                    explaining to Gay why he sent his fifth Biglow poem, "The Debate in the Sennit,
                    Sot to a Nursery Rhyme," to the <em>Boston Courier</em> instead of
                    the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em>, he wrote, "Had I
                    thought of writing it soon enough I should have sent it to you. But it would not
                    have kept so well for a fortnight."<a href="#note15" name="ref15"><span class="noteRef">[15]</span></a> In
                    both cases, Lowell implied that his satire had an expiration date and needed to
                    be fresh to be effective. It is interesting, then, that Lowell spent so much
                    time and effort in revising the poems into a book in 1848.</div>
                <div class="p">To an extent, our research verifies Lowell's self-reporting of the popularity of
                    his Biglow poems. We have found reprints of the poems in newspapers printed in
                    Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New
                    Jersey, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Washington, DC, geographical
                    coverage that encompasses much of the pre-1848 United States. We have even
                    tracked down reprints in newspapers printed in Leeds and Liverpool, England.
                    Access to online databases that in many cases offer advanced full-text searching
                    options has accelerated our search for reprints. To date, we have mined digital
                    databases including <em>Nineteenth Century US Newspapers</em>; <em>America's Historical Newspapers</em>; <em>American Periodicals Series (1740-1900)</em>; <em>American
                        Antiquarian Society Historical Periodicals Collection: Series 3</em>; <em>Accessible Archives</em>; <em>Chronicling
                        America</em>; <em>Nineteenth-Century British Library
                        Newspapers</em>; <em>British Periodicals</em>; <em>British Newspapers 1600-1950</em>; and the <em>London Times</em>. Our search strategies were expressly developed with the
                    nineteenth-century "culture of reprinting" in mind. For example, the Biglow
                    poems rarely appeared with attributions, and if they did, the byline was often a
                    pseudonym ("H.B." or "B. Sawin"), so author searches were largely futile. Title
                    searches also proved to be a dead end in that newspapers regularly retitled the
                    reprinted material. Keyword searches based on character and place names were
                    more effective, as were searches for phrases such as first lines or refrains.
                    However, keeping in mind that the dialect poems featured irregular spelling,
                    punctuation, and slang, we often tried several versions of the same line to
                    accumulate results. As a whole, our searches have harvested almost fifty
                    reprints, meaning that we have found, on average, five or six reprints of each
                    of the nine poems. As we continue to seek out reprints of the Biglow poems, we
                    will supplement digital searches with visits to physical archives.</div>
                <div class="p">This digital edition presents six newspaper reprints of "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER

                    next, our main interest lies in how the poem's presentation in various
                    periodicals shifts its reception by news-hungry readers. As this variorum of
                    Lowell's poem shows, editorial decisions ranging from letter-by-letter
                    typesetting to arrangement on the page juxtaposing it against other news alters
                    its meaning.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em></h2>
                <div class="p">For instance, in the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em>, the
                    poem appeared not in the page four "Poetry" section but on the front page,
                    interspersed with other news of the day. In an otherwise monolithic block of
                    text on a large sheet, the run-over line breaks create extra white space, which
                    attracts the reader's eye, visually announcing it as a poem. But at the same
                    time, it is sandwiched on the front page between editorials and other "news";
                    its placement among news items lends it textual authority even as it calls into
                    question the accuracy of standard "news" accounts of the war. This differs
                    extensively from how poetry was usually presented in the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> on the back page. In the August 26,
                    1847 issue, the poem "Eternal Justice" is separated from the prose, cordoned off
                    in the far left margin under a genre-labeling header (not to mention the fact
                    that it is remanded to the last page). This non-satirical poetry thus has its
                    poetry-ness, not its newsworthiness, highlighted. With the Biglow poem, both are
                    highlighted simultaneously.</div>
                <div class="p">The poem's speaker, an enlisted man named Birdofredum Sawin, explains that
                    rhetoricians like former Massachusetts Secretary of State John Augustus Bolles
                    inspired him to enlist with jingoistic propaganda. But upon his arrival in
                    Mexico, Sawin quickly learns to separate reality from nationalist banalities.
                    "[S]axons would be handy," he writes, "to do the berryin' down here upon the Rio
                    Grandy," where he is ordered to kill Mexicans, whom, before arriving on the
                    scene of war, he'd thought "worn't huming beans," but has since come to realize
                    that, "come to look at 'em, the [sic] ain't much diff'rent from wot we be."
                    Sawin describes a harsh reality much different from the Mexico sold to him by
                    unscrupulous recruiters, and he has come to question the morality of his
                    mission. Sawin ultimately decides, "This goin' where glory waits ye, haint one
                    agreeable feetur," thus sapping the romance from the popular press's call to
                    arms. Historian Robert Johannsen writes, "For many [soldiers] the romance of the
                    war was dispelled by the realities of the soldier's life in a strange and often
                    inhospitable environment. . . . The visions of a romantic war in an exotic land,
                    dreams of 'citron groves or perfumed bowers,' quickly evaporated once the
                    volunteers arrived on the Rio Grande."<a href="#note16" name="ref16"><span class="noteRef">[16]</span></a> Sawin gives voice to
                    this disenchantment by versifying and fictionalizing the letter from the front
                    genre. Through Sawin's comparisons of the ideality of recruiters' and
                    romanticizing writers' visions of the war with its mundane and vicious
                    realities, Lowell responds <em>in</em> the popular press to the
                    largely pro-war rhetoric <em>of</em> the popular press.</div>
                <div class="p">Interestingly, similar sentiments to those ironically expressed in Sawin's letter
                    appear in an editorial in the <em>National Anti-Slavery
                        Standard</em> on page two titled "The Golden Bracelet," which muses on the
                    difference between false recruiting rhetoric and the realities of the war in
                    Mexico. The author editorializes, <blockquote>The last winter they were
                        enlisting men in our vicinity for this War with Mexico. . . . What invited
                        them from their New England mountains and shores and sky?&#x2013;from their
                        fathers and mothers, their brothers and sisters, and dearer than these?
                        Soulless presses, inhuman voices, of Statesmen and partisans, vociferate
                        patriotism, generous love of their father-land and of freedom; then these
                        same presses and sad voices cry out with immitigable eagerness against
                        tories and traitors: Yes, the Tories, to whom God's truth is holier than a
                        Government's Lie, and the sacred laws of nature are dearer than the situates
                        of Tyranny, and loyalty to Heaven is a deeper reverence than slavery to a
                        nefarious administration and a crouching Congress.<a href="#note17" name="ref17"><span class="noteRef">[17]</span></a></blockquote>This, too, is a moral protest against
                    politicians and presses for drawing young men into an immoral war. Both pieces
                    contrast the dictates of national expansion with biblical injunctions and
                    "sacred laws." Though the article is deadly earnest and the poem at points
                    downright silly, both offer the same take on the same topic from different
                    angles in an issue-oriented reform newspaper dedicated to abolishing slavery and
                    to preventing any extension of slavery into Mexico as a result of the war.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>The Liberator</em></h2>
                <div class="p">Whereas the page layout of the reprint in the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em> conflates news and poetry, the poem appeared on
                    the back page in the "Poetry" column in controversial abolitionist editor
                    William Lloyd Garrison's <em>The Liberator</em> on August 27,
                    1847. But, in spite of the layout's separation of Sawin's letter from "news,"
                    the contents of that letter connect extremely well to the news items surrounding
                    it. Most jarring in its juxtaposition with the comic poem is a piece entitled
                    "Returning Volunteers," which appears on the same page. Reprinted from the <em>Cambridge Chronicle</em>, this letter from a woman travelling
                    through Cincinnati to a relative in Cambridge enumerates several encounters with
                    volunteer soldiers returning from the war as she passed through New Orleans,
                    Vicksburg, Louisville, and Cincinnati. She recounts a funeral procession in New
                    Orleans for several officers killed at Buena Vista before detailing with some
                    pathos the crowds on the banks in Vicksburg set to receive returning Mississippi
                    volunteers, "or what was left of them. Out of nine hundred, only three hundred
                    lived to return. Poor fellows, they looked as though they had seen hard
                    services: they were sun burnt, and many appeared as though they were not long
                    for this world." Later in the letter, she writes, "From their appearance one
                    would suppose the volunteers had had enough of Mexico. . . If you could hear
                    some of them relate their hair breath [sic] escapes it would make your hair rise
                    on your head." This woman's description offers a chilling counterpoint to
                    Sawin's misadventures just two columns over. Sawin, too, has seen some "hard
                    service," describes a couple close calls, and is certainly sick of Mexico; but
                    he is not yet close to death (though in a later letter he would become a triple
                    amputee), and the ludicrousness of the poem blunts soldiers' disillusionment
                    with considerable levity. Incredibly, the woman's letter goes on to describe the
                    grim irony of a deadly welcome to soldiers in Cincinnati, where a cannon shot
                    meant to "salute" the returning volunteers killed one and blew both arms off
                    another, one day after having killed another soldier on a different boat with
                    the same cannon.<a href="#note18" name="ref18"><span class="noteRef">[18]</span></a></div>
                <div class="p">Also on the same page as Sawin's letter is the piece "Assassination of a
                    Massachusetts Volunteer," reprinted from the <em>Boston Post</em>.
                    This brief article describes the killing of a soldier traveling "from Monterey
                    to Ceralvo" with several other soldiers. His party "learnt from a straggling
                    Mexican, that one of the Mariner band had caught him with a lasso, and that his
                    throat had been cut, and his body dragged into a chapparal."<a href="#note19" name="ref19"><span class="noteRef">[19]</span></a> This account offers a more
                    grotesque version of Sawin's statement, "You see a feller peekin' out, and, fust
                    you know, a lariat / If [sic] round your throat and you a copse, 'fore you can
                    say, "Wat are ye at?" Of course, the rest of the this issue of <em>The Liberator</em> also included commentary on the war, including a
                    reprinted item from the <em>St. Louis Republican</em> titled "More
                    Volunteers Wanted" and two front-page stories: a reprint from the <em>Ashtabula Sentinel</em> detailing a speech by Congressman C.F.
                    Adams about the war and a report that David Hale, editor of the <em>Journal of Commerce</em> and previous supporter of President
                    Polk, had "come out over his own signature against the origin and prosecution of
                    the war."<a href="#note20" name="ref20"><span class="noteRef">[20]</span></a> So, even though <em>The
                        Liberator</em> separated "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" into its own
                    "Poetry" column, it still spoke to the rest of the news in the paper, offering a
                    comically distorted mirror of news from the Mexican front.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>Littell's Living Age</em></h2>
                <div class="p">The context and reception of "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" as it appeared
                    in <em>Littell's Living Age</em> in September 1847 differs because
                    the medium differs. Unlike the charged, single-minded reform newspapers the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> and <em>The
                        Liberator</em>, <em>Littell's Living Age</em> was a
                    politically eclectic, general interest magazine that, aiming to be a
                    cosmopolitan miscellany for an American audience, mostly reprinted works from
                    European (typically British) sources, thus taking advantage of the absence of an
                    international copyright law.<a href="#note21" name="ref21"><span class="noteRef">[21]</span></a> In this
                    context, Sawin's letter appears not as a plebian voice in debates about the
                    US-Mexico War, but one of many pieces in the magazine describing exotic foreign
                    lands to American readers. A quick perusal of other titles in the September 11,
                    1847 issue of <em>Littell's Living Age</em>&#x2013;"Protest of the
                    Proceedings of the British Near Canton" (in China), "The Out-Station; Or, Jaunts
                    in the Jungle" (set in Ceylon), "A Chinese Ghost Story," "Elections in England,"
                    "The Prussian Die," "Switzerland," etc.&#x2013;attest to this. In keeping with
                    this sense of bringing the news of the world home, editor Eliakim Littell's
                    preface to "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO," like those in the reform
                    newspapers, sets up the poem as war correspondence. He writes, "Having copied
                    many letters from the army in Mexico, we now add one from a correspondent of the
                        <em>Boston Courier</em>."<a href="#note22" name="ref22"><span class="noteRef">[22]</span></a> In this reprinting, then, Biglow goes international, and
                    is situated as one of many points in a constellation of global affairs mediated
                    by an American editor.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>Texas Union</em></h2>
                <div class="p">A month later, Lowell's poems had circulated from these northeastern newspapers
                    published in New York and Boston to a Texas frontier town, San Augustine. The
                    reprint in the <em>Texas Union</em> excerpts only the final
                    fourteen lines of the poem. The heading, "SEEN THE ELEPHANT," makes reference to
                    a common nineteenth-century phrase used to describe disillusionment when the
                    reality of a situation does not correspond with what was imagined.<a href="#note23" name="ref23"><span class="noteRef">[23]</span></a> According to the editor's preface, Sawin has
                    "seen the elephant" because he has discovered that the "officers at home and the
                    same officers in Mexico, are just as different as 'sodgering in fun' and 'in
                    earnest.'" In the excerpt, Sawin complains that the accommodating,
                    alcohol-proffering officers at the recruiting rallies at home in Massachusetts
                    become demanding tyrants in the field. He considers desertion, but he
                    acknowledges that he would face capital punishment if caught, and concludes,
                    "wal, tain't no use a jawin', / I'm safe enlisted for the war." Sawin's poem
                    about "seeing the elephant" directly links to another article on the front page
                    of the <em>Texas Union</em>, titled "Wanted to See the Animal" and
                    credited to the <em>Boston Times</em>. In this anecdote, a
                    visiting yokel sees a sign board advertising <em>Littell's Living
                        Age</em>&#x2013;interestingly, the home of the aforementioned September
                    reprint of Lowell's poem&#x2013;at a print shop. One of the articles in <em>Littell's Living Age</em> mentions "seeing the elephant," and,
                    taking the metaphor literally, the yokel, speaking in dialect akin to Sawin's
                    vernacular, asks to buy a ticket to the circus. Misunderstandings and a near
                    riot ensue before the yokel escapes to the nearest train station to go home to
                    the country. This anecdote preps readers for the title and theme of "SEEN THE
                    ELEPHANT." Significantly, the anecdote about the yokel's mistake is labeled
                    "HUMOROUS," which places it into the category of a joke; on the other hand,
                    Lowell's poem is not labeled as fictional or humorous.<a href="#note24" name="ref24"><span class="noteRef">[24]</span></a> In fact, the editor's preface identifies Sawin as a "pretended
                    Yankee poet, writing home from Mexico," treating Sawin as a genuine soldier and
                    an ersatz poet, when, in fact, the reverse is true.</div>
                <div class="p">Whereas Sawin's disillusionment serves as an opportunity to campaign against the
                    war in the northeastern reform papers, the editor of the <em>Texas
                        Union</em> uses it for a different purpose. The editor, William N. Harman,
                    is explicit about his support of the war. In an editorial on page two, Harman
                    announces, "Taking it for granted then, that every true friend of this
                    country&#x2013;every patriotic Texan, is a supporter of all those measures
                    growing out of annexation, the <em>Texas Union</em> will
                    fearlessly enter the lists in defence of those measures, and hold itself in
                    readiness to repel the assaults of the Whig Press." In addition to this outright
                    declaration of the paper's support for the Democrat Party and, concurrently, the
                    war, an ode titled "Hero Portraits," which depicts idealized US generals
                    including Taylor and Scott, appears on page four. Also, Harman celebrates the
                    success of recruitment rallies in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana in an article
                    titled "Military." The editor praises the "chivalry" of the "brave b'hoys" who
                    volunteered, and he also draws special attention to the Tennessee rallies, in
                    which muster quotas were not only met but surpassed. Harman writes, "Huzza for
                    East Tennessee! She can't be beat in patriotic devotion to country! Her sons are
                    ever foremost when their country calls!" Keeping in mind this fervent praise for
                    volunteers, Harman's decision to excerpt the section of Sawin's poem that
                    mentions his desire to desert may seem contradictory. Yet, Harman is careful to
                    point out that Sawin and his flip-flopping officers are from Massachusetts. In
                    this context, Sawin's disillusionment is portrayed as Yankee cowardice in
                    contrast to the Southern volunteers, who do not question "the justice or
                    injustice of the cause&#x2014;as to the right or wrong of the thing&#x2014;but only [ask],
                    'does the country need our services? If so, we are ready!'"<a href="#note25" name="ref25"><span class="noteRef">[25]</span></a></div>
                <div class="p">Harman's political leanings were typical of Texan printers during this time
                    period. According to Marilyn McAdams Sibley's study of antebellum Texas
                    newspapers, editors "tied the appreciation in value of [their] land and business
                    to the continued growth of the republic" and as a result "subscribed
                    wholeheartedly not only to the unwritten rule of printing nothing that would
                    hurt the country but also to the corollary of that rule, that what would hurt
                    the country would also hurt them." Editors needed to please local advertisers
                    and subscribers to prosper, and the "predominance of the Democrats and the
                    weakness of other parties" dictated those tastes.<a href="#note26" name="ref26"><span class="noteRef">[26]</span></a> Situated in San Augustine, a frontier town in
                    which basic institutions such as a library, district court, and school were all
                    still under construction, Harman's newspaper business was tenuous. In addition
                    to this generalized fear of pecuniary pain, Harman may have been further
                    motivated by fear of bodily harm. Harman's predecessor, James Russell, had been
                    murdered in a gunfight with another editor, Henry A. Kendall, who then fled
                        town.<a href="#note27" name="ref27"><span class="noteRef">[27]</span></a> Anxious to put that drama to bed, Harman
                    bought Russell and Kendall's competing papers and united them under the new
                    title <em>Texas Union</em>, the first issue of which reprinted the
                    Lowell poem. Harman's pro-Southern, pro-war sentiments, geared to please his
                    local community, shaped his reframing of Lowell's poem from anti-war satire to
                    anti-Yankee propaganda.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>New Hampshire Sentinel</em></h2>
                <div class="p">The <em>Texas Union</em>'s editor rails against the Whig press in
                    the issue in which the excerpt appears. But avowedly Whig newspapers, of course,
                    also reprinted the Sawin poem. For example, in November 1847, the <em>New Hampshire Sentinel</em> (Keene, NH) reprints "LETTER FROM
                    A VOLUNTEER IN SALTILLO" as well as Hosea Biglow's frame letter under the
                    heading "Miscellaneous." Abutting the poem are several other authentic letters
                    about Mexico. Immediately following it is "A Mexican Letter," which describes
                    the capture of Mexico City. Interestingly, this letter was written by a Mexican
                    citizen, providing a viewpoint that contrasts with the typical "letter from the
                    front" genre. The letter describes the US soldiers as a "patrol of foreigners,
                    who entered triumphant, shedding the blood of our people."<a href="#note28" name="ref28"><span class="noteRef">[28]</span></a> Another letter on the same page from an American soldier
                    encamped at the Mexican National Palace gives a detailed description of a battle
                    in which Colonel Ransom and several other US soldiers were killed. Yet another
                    letter written by a Southerner explains that the war is necessary because the
                    South "must have an outlet for our slaves." The editor prints this letter as
                    proof of the immorality of the war, which he deems "unconstitutional" and
                        "unnatural."<a href="#note29" name="ref29"><span class="noteRef">[29]</span></a> On the same
                    page, in an article titled "War News," the editor writes that since there have
                    been "no official despatches" from Mexico, he must rely on "scattering small
                    official and private letters" for news from the frontlines.<a href="#note30" name="ref30"><span class="noteRef">[30]</span></a> In this context, Sawin's letter is treated one of several letters
                    that give first-hand accounts of the war. In this same issue, the <em>New Hampshire Sentinel</em> also reprints another Biglow poem;
                    "What Mr. Robinson Thinks" is printed on the fourth page under the heading,
                    "Orchestra." This poem's critique of Massachusetts politics links to the
                    newspaper's celebration of the recent victories of several Whig politicians,
                    whom the editor champions in part because of their anti-war sentiments.</div>
                <div class="p">The <em>New Hampshire Sentinel</em> was founded in 1799 by John
                    Prentiss, who passed the editorial torch to his son J.W. Prentiss in 1846, the
                    year before the Biglow poems appeared in the newspaper. Both Prentiss senior and
                    junior shaped the paper to reflect their Whig politics, condemnation of the war,
                    and support for temperance, religious freedom, and education reform.<a href="#note31" name="ref31"><span class="noteRef">[31]</span></a> This interest in
                    reform may explain how Prentiss came in contact with the Lowell poems; for
                    instance, Prentiss, like many editors, culled material from exchange papers, and
                    he may have subscribed to reform papers like the <em>National
                        Anti-Slavery Standard</em> and <em>The Liberator</em>. In
                    addition, Prentiss apprenticed in Boston and had been a member of elite literary
                    and printing circles in the city.<a href="#note32" name="ref32"><span class="noteRef">[32]</span></a> This personal network may help explain the circulation of the
                    Biglow poems to Keene, New Hampshire. This close contextualization of the
                    intertwined personal and political connections between printers and editors
                    evinces the way in which the very local can telescope outward to reveal the
                    dynamics of distribution and the stories behind the links between regional and
                    urban nodes in the antebellum US print network.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>Meliboeus-Hipponax: The Biglow Papers</em></h2>
                <div class="p">In 1848, Lowell set out to collect his Biglow poems into a book edition, making
                    copious corrections to the poems. As the comparison of witnesses in this digital
                    edition shows, he tinkered endlessly with Biglow's New England dialect. An even
                    bigger and more time-consuming revision involved a huge expansion of the role of
                    Parson Homer Wilbur, Biglow's fictional editor. Whereas in the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> pieces Wilbur makes only a few brief
                    introductory or explanatory appearances, in the book his role swells egregiously
                    to over half the manuscript, thus overshadowing the more interesting characters
                    of the folksy Biglow and the raucous Sawin. For instance, in the <em>National Anti-Slavery Standard</em> reprint the editorial
                    framing, including headline, amounts to just over 250 words. In the book
                    version, Wilbur's tiresome introduction and afterword framing the poem add up to
                    over 1600 words, approximately the same word count as the poem itself. As Lowell
                    later explained this decision, "When I came to collect them and publish them in
                    a volume, I conceived my parson-editor with his pedantry and verbosity, his
                    amiable vanity and superiority to the verses he was editing, as a fitting
                    artistic background and foil. It gave me the chance, too, of glancing obliquely
                    at many things which were beyond the horizon of my other characters."<a href="#note33" name="ref33"><span class="noteRef">[33]</span></a> But in these dense and highly
                    allusive prose interventions, Lowell as Wilbur prattles wanderingly about
                    poetry, his parishioners, and historical precedents for the invasion of Mexico.
                    Thus Wilbur's interruptions are more a Swiftian satire on the book than a
                    critique of the US-Mexico War. Additionally, the juxtaposition of Wilbur's
                    pedantry to Biglow's unlearned but earnest fervor is quite jarring. Cameron
                    Nickels aptly describes the numbing effect that Wilbur's prominence in the book
                    has on the satire: "Although his [Wilbur's] learned notes do often address the
                    issues raised by the dialect letter-poems, his elaborate, scholarly analyses,
                    abundant with Latin quotations and etymologies, too often undercut the moral
                    thrust of the rustic, ironic speakers and reduce their humorous admissions of
                    guilt to tediously pedantic inconsequentiality."<a href="#note34" name="ref34"><span class="noteRef">[34]</span></a></div>
                <div class="p">Lowell's wholesale changes also delayed publication of the book. He complained to
                    Gay in early September 1848, "I am as busy as I can be with Mr. Biglow's poems,
                    of which I have got between twenty and thirty pages already printed. It is the
                    hardest book to print that I ever had anything to do with, and, what with
                    corrections and Mr. Wilbur's annotations, keeps me more employed than I care to
                        be."<a href="#note35" name="ref35"><span class="noteRef">[35]</span></a> Lowell had hoped to publish
                    it in time to influence the November presidential election, steering
                    anti-slavery voters away from General Zachary Taylor and towards the Free-Soil
                    Party candidate Martin Van Buren. But by time of its publication by Putnam in
                    December 1848 the book, titled <em>Meliboeus-Hipponax: The Biglow
                        Papers</em>, the war was over; Whig Zachary Taylor, a target of two Biglow
                    poems, was elected president; and Lowell's satire was already out of date.<a href="#note36" name="ref36"><span class="noteRef">[36]</span></a> The once
                    hot-button issues the poems addressed were suddenly old news.</div>
            
            
                <h2><em>Sunbury American</em></h2>
                <div class="p">Soon after the book's publication, an excerpt of "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER IN
                    SALTILLO" appeared in the <em>Sunbury American</em>, a local
                    weekly newspaper printed in Sunbury, Pennsylvania. Titled "Sogering in Mexico,"
                    the reprint includes sixteen lines from "LETTER FROM A VOLUNTEER," as well as
                    thirty-two lines from "A Second Letter from B. Sawin, Esq.," which was published
                    almost a year after the first Sawin letter. The reprint appears without
                    attribution or any sort of preface, meaning the editor does not explain that the
                    reprint samples two separate poems. Instead, the editor seamlessly weaves the
                    excerpts into a single, cohesive poem that reflects on Sawin's disillusionment
                    about war. In the remixed reprint, Sawin notes that his training was much
                    different from actually killing a man, and the recruiter's promises of gold,
                    glory, and "<small>GLORIOUS FUN</small>" never materialized, at
                    least not for the enlisted men; his superior officers, on the other hand, did
                    get to "revel in the halls o' Montezumy." Because this version of the poem was
                    printed after the war had ended, the editor treats it as fiction rather than
                    news from the front. He labels it as "Select Poetry," and it abuts a sentimental
                    Christmas story and anecdotes about two literary figures, John Keats and Sir
                    Walter Scott.</div>
                <div class="p">However, the editor did manage to make his remixed Sawin poem timely in that it
                    accompanies several articles about the discovery of gold in California,
                    territory newly acquired by the United States as a result of the war. Johannsen
                    points out that only "[s]ix weeks after President Polk had declared the Mexican
                    War officially at an end, a letter from a New York volunteer in California . . .
                    [mentioned] that a 'gold mine' had recently been discovered," which led pro-war
                    espousers of Manifest Destiny to believe that "God had kept the gold hidden
                    until the land came into the possession of the American republic."<a href="#note37" name="ref37"><span class="noteRef">[37]</span></a> In the <em>Sunbury American</em>, "The Gold
                    Fever" discusses the costs of different routes to California, one of which
                    traveled through Vera Cruz and Acapulco, sites of previous US-Mexico War
                    battles. Both "California&#x2013;Its Commercial Advantages, &amp;c." and
                    "Official&#x2013;The Gold Essayed&#x2013;Extraordinary Purity" comment on the
                    potential financial opportunities of this spoil of the war. However, the editor
                    tempers these temptations with several reality checks. He reprints
                    "Congressional Proceedings," which reports on Congress's dismissal of a bill
                    requesting the convening of a state constitutional convention to include both US
                    and former Mexican citizens, suggesting that the incorporation of this new
                    territory into the US body-politic may be more complicated than it seems. The
                    editor also expresses his skepticism about the Gold Rush in two articles. "The
                    Gold Region" reviews several travel narratives about California and surmises,
                    "we ascribe three fourths to exaggeration, produced by excitement. Each of the
                    narrators seems to have been dazzled, and in no condition to consider sober
                        realities."<a href="#note38" name="ref38"><span class="noteRef">[38]</span></a> Likewise, in "California
                    Gold Mines," the editor writes, "The present excitement, in regard to the gold
                    mines in California will result in the speedy settlement of that country by
                    American citizens, but we venture to predict that nine tenths of those who go
                    out to realize fortunes in hunting for gold will be disappointed."<a href="#note39" name="ref39"><span class="noteRef">[39]</span></a> The editor's suggestion that the promise of the Gold
                    Rush may not match up with the reality thematically connects to his remix of the
                    Sawin poems, in which Sawin laments the disconnect between recruiter's promises
                    and the realities of war.</div>
                <div class="p">This balanced viewpoint fits with the overall tone of the newspaper, which was
                    "generally regarded as the expression of conservative and unbiased opinion,"
                    according to a local historian. So unbiased was the editor, the local history
                    claims, that he occasionally used this Democratic organ in a Democratic county
                    to support non-Democratic candidates. The editor of the <em>Sunbury American</em>, Henry B. Masser, was a self-educated
                    lawyer-turned-newspaperman who was "recognized as a trenchant and forcible
                    writer, and a sagacious observer of the political and social movements of the
                    day." Under his tenure, the periodical was "one of the most influential journals
                    in central Pennsylvania" and enjoyed "extensive circulation throughout this
                    section of the State."<a href="#note40" name="ref40"><span class="noteRef">[40]</span></a> Further expanding
                    the influence of his newspaper, Masser published a German-language version, <em>Der Deutsche Amerikaner</em>; unfortunately, we have yet to
                    track down a copy of the December 23, 1848 issue of <em>Der
                        Deutsche Amerikaner</em> to examine if it prints a German translation of the
                    Sawin remix poem. Considering the wide circulation, multilingual editions, and
                    local reputation of Masser, the <em>Sunbury American</em>
                    demonstrates not only that Lowell's poems infiltrated beyond urban centers but
                    also that local papers were powerful sites for the distribution and
                    dissemination of information in their own right.</div>
                <div class="p">The <em>Sunbury American</em>'s deployment of Sawin's poem after
                    the war had ended shows how the poem lived on beyond Lowell's original intent as
                    a satirical, anti-war, antislavery protest poem. Later iterations of the poem in
                    reprints further demonstrate its longevity. For instance, fifty years after its
                    first publication, four lines from the poem appeared in a Honolulu newspaper,
                        <em>The Independent</em>, in an editorial about the US
                    annexation of Hawaii. The editorial takes its title from Lowell's poem and links
                    US colonialism in Hawaii to the US-Mexico War, noting that in both cases, "the
                    white men" used the ideology of Manifest Destiny and the civilizing mission as a
                    cover for "committing the highest crime known in international
                    relations&#x2013;stealing from a people their government and their lands."<a href="#note41" name="ref41"><span class="noteRef">[41]</span></a> In the early twentieth century, an untitled article in
                    Greenville, Kentucky's <em>The Record</em> cites the poem. After
                    announcing that "[a]ll the dark-skinned races look alike to the white man," the
                    racist article claims, "It is true that we believe, in our political literature,
                    that all men were created free and equal, but practically we make the
                    qualification of Hosea Biglow during the Mexican war, that 'every man don't mean
                    a nigger or a Mexican.'"<a href="#note42" name="ref42"><span class="noteRef">[42]</span></a> In its original incarnation, this
                    line parodied the racist pro-Anglo-Saxon rhetoric of one of the war's major
                    military figures, Caleb Cushing. However, in <em>The Record</em>,
                    the editor misreads the poem's satirical rhetoric, quotes a single line stripped
                    of context, and uses it to defend de facto discrimination in a reversal of
                    Lowell's spirit of protest. Although we do not include these two mentions as
                    witnesses in our digital edition because of their brevity, they evince the
                    malleable afterlife of the poem in the hands of editors across a spectrum of
                    political motivations.</div>
            
            
                <h2>Editorial Approach</h2>
                <div class="p">To prepare this digital edition, we began by transcribing each reprint as a
                    separate text file. In these diplomatic transcriptions, we preserved all
                    irregular spelling and punctuation in the original because we wanted to record
                    the dialect as is without correction. We decide to record each line of poetry
                    without arbitrary line breaks or indentation caused by varying column widths. We
                    also did not record stanza breaks because they varied and were often difficult
                    to discern on newspaper pages. Once all the transcriptions were complete, we
                    collated the witnesses with Juxta Commons, an online editorial tool developed by
                    NINES that offers collation of comparison sets, several forms of visualization
                    of variants, the option to export as TEI P5 file, and the option to publish
                    results online. In particular, we chose Juxta Commons because it creates a TEI
                    file that uses parallel segmentation to juxtapose the different witnesses.
                    According to the TEI P5 Guidelines, parallel segmentation is "useful where
                    editors do not wish to privilege a text as the 'base' or when editors wish to
                    present parallel texts."<a href="#note43" name="ref43"><span class="noteRef">[43]</span></a> This element of
                    openness reflects our desire to privilege multiplicity rather than an
                    authoritative text. Web technology, of course, if perfectly suited to such an
                    approach. Whereas traditional print editing identifies different versions of a
                    text, creates a conspectus of various readings, makes a single text through a
                    process of combination, and presents to the reader a single text, digital
                    editing, as Peter Robinson points out in "New Directions in Critical Editing,"
                    allows editors to bypass these last two stages and "simply present all the
                    accumulated evidence for all the different states of the text."<a href="#note44" name="ref44"><span class="noteRef">[44]</span></a> This edition is
                    the embodiment of an argument that circulating texts like Lowell's Biglow poems
                    should not be seen as either going "from bad to worse"<a href="#note45" name="ref45"><span class="noteRef">[45]</span></a> as they appear and reappear or as imperfect
                    instantiations to be collated into an authoritative text representing the
                    author's ultimate intention. Rather, this digital edition invites readers to
                    consider these reprints as separate iterations that shift to fit the needs of
                    different news contexts. Hence, we want to highlight not our own editorial
                    decisions, but those of newspaper editors in 1847-48, as well as the role that
                    readers&#x2013;then and now&#x2013;play in making meaning through the reading of
                    the poem as it appears in juxtaposition with the news content it adumbrates. The
                    parallel segmentation structure created by collating our witnesses through Juxta
                    Commons helps us achieve this goal.</div>
                <div class="p">Our first trial run using Juxta Commons proved problematic because of the wide
                    variety in our witnesses: some had extensive prefatory material, while others
                    had none. Also, two of our witnesses, the <em>Texas Union</em> and
                    the <em>Sunbury American</em>, were excerpts, which created
                    misalignments when the Juxta collation attempted to match up the texts line by
                    line. Our second run, in which we only included the body of the poem in the
                    witnesses that reprinted the entire poem, was much clearer. Then we manually
                    added any prefatory material, the excerpts, and the concluding prose appended to
                    the poem in the book edition. We structured the xml document to reflect this
                    variety of formats. In the front matter, we listed various titles under the
                    "head," any introductory text penned by the editor as "preface," and Hosea
                    Biglow's framing text as "letter." Then we placed the poem in the "body." One of
                    the reprints, the book edition, included an appendix, which is included in the
                    markup as back matter. To ensure that we had not introduced error or
                    accidentally autocorrected an irregular dialect spelling during this
                    transcription process, we performed a round of double-checking at this point. At
                    this stage, we also manually entered instances of italics or small caps, tagged
                    the markup with "placeName" and "persName", and demarcated uses of Latin and
                    Ancient Greek as foreign languages. We decided not to mark the Spanish words
                    within the poem as foreign because at the time the poem was printed, these words
                    were incorporated into the US vernacular and would not have required
                    translation. As Johannsen points out, the "Mexican War brought many more Spanish
                    words and phrases into American speech . . . Such words as adobe, ranchero,
                    chaparral, sombrero, lasso, corral, hacienda, peon, calaboose, fandango, and
                    patio (the list could go on) came into common use."<a href="#note46" name="ref46"><span class="noteRef">[46]</span></a> Several
                    of these specific words&#x2013;including "chaparral," "fandango," and
                    "lasso"&#x2013;appear in Lowell's poem.</div>
                <div class="p">In the next stage of our editorial process, we marked each site of variance
                    between the witnesses as one of four categories: punctuation, orthographic,
                    alteration, and substantive. This categorization revealed several trends as the
                    poem evolved over time. First, the majority of the variants were due to changes
                    in punctuation and spelling that occurred when Lowell compiled the book edition.
                    He systematically made the dialect more irregular. For instance, the standard
                    "and" in the earlier newspaper reprints is universally changed to "an'" in the
                    book, and the same occurs with "as" to "ez," "was" to "wuz," "that" to "thet,"
                    "had" to "hed" and so on. In the glossary that he created for his <em>Biglow Papers</em> book, Lowell offered "translations" of
                    these slang spellings into proper English. Categorization of variants by type
                    also revealed that the <em>Sunbury American</em> tends to follow
                    the book's spelling and punctuation, leading us to believe that the editor of
                    that newspaper used the book, not an exchange paper, as his source. (That the
                        <em>Sunbury American</em> reprints a later Sawin poem and
                    appeared after the book's publication strengthens this claim of lineage.) In
                    addition to noting instances of orthographic or punctuation changes, we also
                    marked substantive variants in which entire words or phrases were altered. In
                    particular, following line ninety-eight, Lowell added four lines to the book
                    version. The other major variation among witnesses has to do with Hosea Biglow's
                    explanatory notes. Four of the newspapers reprints include these notes,
                    interspersing them throughout the poem. The book includes all but one of these
                    notes but locates them beneath the poem as footnotes. The book also includes an
                    explanatory note signed by Homer Wilbur. Two of the witnesses excised the notes.
                    For the witnesses that included them, we transcribed each of these explanatory
                    notes and marked them as "authorial." In a few cases, we also classified a
                    variant as an alteration when the appearance of a word or phrase differed, but
                    largely the appearance stayed the same from edition to edition. Finally, we
                    added annotations to the poem about context such as historical figures, literary
                    allusions, and nineteenth-century slang to help modern readers understand the
                    poem.</div>
                <div class="p">Though, as this introduction shows, we are most interested in investigations of
                    the poem's relationship to the news surrounding it in each edition, we
                    ultimately decided not to transcribe and encode selected articles from each
                    newspaper. Instead, we invite readers to review the images of these pages and,
                    building on the juxtapositions we have elaborated here, identify their own
                    connections between Lowell's poem and other news content. This, we hope, engages
                    the reader in a receptive process similar to that of news-addicted subscribers
                    reading the poem in 1847 and 1848 and fits with our contention that each
                    separate context offers a horizon fruitful for meaning-making.</div>
