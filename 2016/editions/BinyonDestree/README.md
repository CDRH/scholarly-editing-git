Please describe any other key features of your markup.
------------------------------------------------------

The alignment of transcription and translation was done with InterText which, unfortunately, I couldn't get to supply unique identifiers for the two versions. The table in BinyonDestree.original.translation.xml provides the manually adjusted correspondences between <s id> tags in the two documents. Many thanks for all of your help during the encoding process and I hope that the xml documents will work.

Please describe any visualizations you feel are key for styling your edition.
