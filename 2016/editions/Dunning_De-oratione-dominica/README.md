What types of notes does your edition include?
----------------------------------------------

Notes spread throughout the edition.

Please describe any other key features of your markup.
------------------------------------------------------

Segments are used to show the correlation between the two works. Other palaeographical evidence is recorded using the EpiDoc customization (editorial expansions, substitutions). The approximate locations of the line breaks from the manuscript are included in the translations to allow for approximate parallel display.

Please describe any visualizations you feel are key for styling your edition.

It would be ideal to have a way to visualize the segments borrowed between the two texts. I am imagining something akin to the standard view of a diff program, showing the texts in parallel and highlighting the passages (but I recognize that this could be complicated). I would suggest both documentary/diplomatic and regularized views for the Latin text, perhaps with the ability to toggle the line breaks/hyphenation, expansions, and corrections individually.
