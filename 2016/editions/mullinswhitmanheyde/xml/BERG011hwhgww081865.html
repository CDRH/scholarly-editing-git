                    Friday night, pretty late.
                    This letter is not dated. From the comments in the letter,
                            however, it appears that George has returned home from his Civil War
                            military service. He was mustered out of the Union Army on July 27,
                            1865, and returned to Brooklyn "to resume his life as a civilian,"
                            according to Jerome M. Loving. See The Civil War
                                Letters of George Washington Whitman, ed. Jerome M. Loving
                            (Durham, N.C.: Duke UP, 1975), 27. This letter can tentatively
                            be dated as August 1865.Dear brother George.
                    George
                        Washington Whitman (1829-1901) was the seventh child of Walter and Louisa
                        Whitman, and ten years younger than Walt. George worked as a carpenter prior
                        to his military service during the Civil War. When the war ended, he became
                        a pipe inspector for the City of Camden and the New York Metropolitan Water
                        Board. See Martin G. Murray, "Whitman, George Washington," Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
                        Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998),777-778I am glad you are home again, I cantbear to think of not seeing you this time. so if you can you must come out
                here, if you are well;I cant tempt you with any thing, only we want to see youI expect George you would like to rest home. &#x2014;I hear of your having work
                    writing.
                    In her letter to Walt
                    Whitman dated August 8, 1865, Mother Whitman notes that George "has had much
                    writing to do," probably related to paperwork that he had to fill out as he left
                    military service ("Walt Whitman Archive)..
                I dontwant you to overwork to make yourself ill, but come if you can. I hope next
                time you come home to be able to come to see you I will write a line to you
                again&#x2013; if I dont hear from you I am tired to night our place is pretty plaine here George.
                    Hannah is
                    referring to the house that she and Heyde owned on 21 Pearl Street in
                    Burlington. They purchased the house in May 1864. but I dontthink of that. I should like to have you come so muchGood nightHanThis work is licensed under a Creative
