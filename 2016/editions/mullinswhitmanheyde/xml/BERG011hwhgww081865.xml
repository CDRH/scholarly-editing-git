                            however, it appears that George has returned home from his Civil War
                            military service. He was mustered out of the Union Army on July 27,
                            1865, and returned to Brooklyn "to resume his life as a civilian,"
                            according to Jerome M. Loving. See <hi rend="italic">The Civil War
