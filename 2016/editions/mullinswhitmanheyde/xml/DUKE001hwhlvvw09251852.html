                much I have been away four weeks (that is longer than ever before Walter knows how
                home sick I was when I was at Greenport<sup><a name="note4" href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. I wish Walter and Jeffy was here<sup><a name="note5" href="#ref5">5</a></sup> they could take
                long walks enough It is the queerist looking place here you ever saw just room enough to walk between the
                mountains. there is plenty of Bears and some Panthers and plenty of Hedge Hoggs, and snakes. We have quite a large room furnished with half a dozen chairs
                a very nice stove two beds, table, clock and rocking chair so we can accomadate any of you that is a mind to come and see us.</p>
