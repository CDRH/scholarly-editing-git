                        not dated. Because Hannah refers to “being away four weeks,” “longer than
                        ever before,” the date can be determined as September 25&#8211;30, 1852. Hannah
                        and Charles Heyde arrived in North Dorset on August 26, 1852, as reported in
                        a letter from Heyde to Mother Whitman dated August 27, 1852 &#40;Trent

                    &#40;1827&#8211;1863&#41;, the sixth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman. Like his father and
                    brothers, Andrew was a carpenter; he later served in the Union Army briefly
                    during the Civil War. Andrew was married to Nancy McClure, but not much is known
                    about the date or the circumstances of their marriage. Hannah’s phrase “is
                    reported to be married to” suggests that Andrew’s marriage was not an event that
                    Whitman family members attended. Jerome Loving reports that Nancy may have been
                    Andrew’s “common-law wife.” See Martin G. Murray, “Whitman, Andrew Jackson
