                <span class="salute">Dear Mother</span>
            </span>
            <p>I am sitting up and feel much better or stronger but the least agitation talking or
                anything even eating I will be covered with prespiration but dear Mother I am so anxious about my hand I fear I shall lose my
                    thumb<sup><a name="note2" href="#ref2">2</a></sup> I cant see it gets feels or looks much better, it pained me last night more than
                usual asked Dr Thayer<sup><a name="note3" href="#ref3">3</a></sup> if it would be six months before it got better he
                could not tell I asked if it would be three months before he said yes. I asked if I
                would lose the use of my hand he said no, but I would never <u>have a</u> perfect hand such severe cases always left its effects, I am very
                uneasy about it I cant bear to be so helpless I shall learn to do some thing with one hand I
                shall try to sew when I get stronger, my sickness has been hard for all about me its
                the most troublesome to care for of all diseases now I dress my hand &amp; I hope
                soon to be able to do most things for myself I can walk, &#x2014; yesterday is the
                first I walked alone, &#x2014; I wish dear Mother I could come home I want so much to
                see you all once more, if my hand would only get better, I shall write to you often
                now dear Mother you cant tell how I have longed for letters from home, Mattie<sup><a name="note4" href="#ref4">4</a></sup> has not written yet, I was glad it done me good to hear
                she was better Walts &amp; your letter I was glad to get sick or well I am much interested in Walts books<sup><a name="note5" href="#ref5">5</a></sup> I thought of it all night I dont want to be troublesome but I wish Walt would write often &#x2014; </p>

        
    
</div><div class="notesList"><h2>Notes</h2><ul><li><a href="#note1" name="ref1"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span></a> This date, written by Charles Heyde on his letter to Mother
                            Whitman, may be considered accurate. Heydes missive frames Hannahs
                            letter to Mother Whitman. His comments about Hannah &#x2014; she is a
                            child, about herself like an infant almost that was out in the cold are
                            contradicted by Hannahs lucid statements that she is concerned about the
                            use of her hand and her ability to continue to do everyday tasks like
                            sewing.</li><li><a href="#note2" name="ref2"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span></a>In November 1868, Hannah
                    suffered from a painful infection on her left thumb which Mother Whitman
                    describes in a letter to Walt Whitman (dated Nov. 11-14, 1868, <em>Walt Whitman Archive</em>) as erysiplas &#x2014; erysipelas, a bacterial
                    infection similar to cellulitis.</li><li><a href="#note3" name="ref3"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span></a>Dr. Samuel White
                    Thayer, Jr. (1817-1882), graduated from Vermont Medical College in 1838 and
                    moved to Burlington in 1852. Although his practice was general medicine, his
                    specialty was surgery, and he performed numerous amputations. Professor of
                    Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Vermont from 1854 to 1871, during
                    the Civil War he served as Surgeon General of Vermont. See H. Royce Bass, <em>The History of Braintree, Vermont</em> (Tuttle: Rutland,
                    Vermont, 1883), 58.</li><li><a href="#note4" name="ref4"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span></a>Martha Emma Mitchell Whitman (1836-1873), married
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman on February 23, 1859. Affectionately known as Mattie,
                    not much is known about her background prior to her marriage. Jeff and Mattie
                    moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867 Jeff accepted
                    a position as Chief Engineer and Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis,
                    Missouri. Hannah refers to Mattie getting better, but she began to suffer from
                    chronic illnesses beginning in early 1863. At the time of this letter Mattie was
                    visiting New York, seeking counsel from doctors about her health. See <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>, ed.
                    Randall H. Waldron (New York: New York UP, 1977), 2, and Walt Whitman's letter
