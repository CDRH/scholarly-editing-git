                            Whitman, may be considered accurate. Heyde's missive frames Hannah's
                            letter to Mother Whitman. His comments about Hannah &#8212; "she is a
                            child, about herself like an infant <choice><sic>allmost</sic><corr>almost</corr></choice>, that was out in the cold" &#8212; are
                            contradicted by Hannah's lucid statements that she is concerned about the
                            use of her hand and her ability to continue to do everyday tasks like
                            sewing.</note>

                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman on February 23, 1859. Affectionately known as Mattie,
                    not much is known about her background prior to her marriage. Jeff and Mattie
                    moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867 Jeff accepted
                    a position as chief engineer and superintendent of waterworks in St. Louis,
                    Missouri. Hannah refers to Mattie getting better, but Mattie began to suffer from
                    chronic illnesses beginning in early 1863. At the time of this letter Mattie was
                    visiting New York, seeking counsel from doctors about her health. See <hi
