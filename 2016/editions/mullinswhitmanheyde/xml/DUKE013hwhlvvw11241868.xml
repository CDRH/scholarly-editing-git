                            Whitman, may be considered accurate. Heydes missive frames Hannahs
                            letter to Mother Whitman. His comments about Hannah &#8212; she is a
                            child, about herself like an infant almost that was out in the cold are
                            contradicted by Hannahs lucid statements that she is concerned about the
                            use of her hand and her ability to continue to do everyday tasks like
                            sewing.</note>

                    not much is known about her background prior to her marriage. Jeff and Mattie
                    moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867 Jeff accepted
                    a position as Chief Engineer and Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis,
                    Missouri. Hannah refers to Mattie getting better, but she began to suffer from
                    chronic illnesses beginning in early 1863. At the time of this letter Mattie was
