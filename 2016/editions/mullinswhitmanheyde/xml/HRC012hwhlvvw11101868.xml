Affectionately known as Mattie, not much is known about her background prior to her marriage. Jeff and Mattie moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867 Jeff accepted a position as Chief Engineer and Superintendent of 
Water Works in St. Louis, Missouri.  Hannah refers to Mattie getting better, but Mattie began to suffer from chronic illnesses beginning in early 1863. At the time of this letter Mattie was visiting New York, seeking counsel from doctors about 
her health.  See <hi rend="italic">MATTIE: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</hi>, ed. Randall H. Waldron (New York: New York UP, 1977), 2, and Walt Whitmans letter to Jeff Whitman, October 25, 1868 (<hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman
