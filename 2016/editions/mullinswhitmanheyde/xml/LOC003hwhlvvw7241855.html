            <p>we do not hear a word from any of you I think if you was sick some of them would send
                me word I have been wishing and expecting to hear from you every day we shall be
                here some days longer. I wish some of you would write a line or two. I am very
                anxious I am so afraid you are sick, I am not very well myself my appetite is not
                good at all not being very strong any trouble knocks me up completely I want very
                much to see you (a lady boarder in the house, 
                ) came to see her yesterday I quite envied her I dont know or speak to anyone in the house, this ladies husband indulges her he will hardly let her walk down stairs I have only
                seen her down once he has her meals sent up she is quite humored enough and I dont think needed her mother as much as I do) &#x2014;Mother dear perhaps my
                writing about such trifles will take your mind a little I wish it could, do you ever
                wonder Mother how I am getting along you have enough other things to think of and
                enough other trouble. I do hope you feel somewhat reconciled and cheerful by this
                time I know by myself ones mind affects the body so very much dont get sick dear Mother, I am afraid I write rather meloncholy, I ought to write more cheerfully, but you know I cannot disguise my
                feelings very much I do not feel cheerful, if I could have seen and spoken to Father
                I am afraid I make you feel bad Mother I have no one here to speak to, I expect the
                boys all try to appear cheerful and would not like my writing what would renew your

            <p>I wish some of you would write immediately before we leave here I dont know how long we shall be here did you get that line I wrote the day we
                came here, I was very sick and miserable that day but I rode from Clarendon
                    Springs<sup><a name="note2" href="#ref2">2</a></sup>
                here, (six or seven miles) in an open wagon very ruff stony road. I would liked its being ruff once but my side is weak it hurt me some, once so I almost screamed our
                being there was very expensive and unpleasant for me but Charlie liked it (they
                generally come down to Rutland<sup><a name="note3" href="#ref3">3</a></sup> in a Coach they had hired it to a party for that day. Charlie
                paid half a dollar each for our riding here in that unpleasant (for me)
                manner, and $2, 50 cents for our being taken down our expences there was $1.50 each a day besides other little things, here our expences are $2, each a day thats is what we expect,) Dear Mother I speak of all these little things to
                take your mind, its possible we may remain here in Rutland some weeks I dont know where we shall go next early in September Charlie is going to Lake

                <sup><a name="note4" href="#ref4">4</a></sup> positively he is not doing anything here the
                scenery here does not suit him Mr Baxter<sup><a name="note5" href="#ref5">5</a></sup> (the one
                he thought to paint some views for has no time ever to see about any thing but his own business he does not want any thing at any rate at present if he ever does he has taken 15 tickets in the rafle<sup><a name="note6" href="#ref6">6</a></sup> for a painting Charlie brought with us from B.F.)<sup><a name="note7" href="#ref7">7</a></sup>
                Mr Baxter was the cause of Charlie comeing here he is a very fine man Charlie thinks, Charlie expenses are of course very great he has found very much fault with my
                being with him, with its being double expence he has pretty large prices for his pictures the one here is to be raffled
                for this week at $150, and has an order to paint one at Lake Champlain at the
                same price perhaps Charlie would not like my speaking of his buisiness. some persons were travelling gave him an order. I will speak more about
                it next time I wish to send this letter today I intend or should like to come home
                pretty soon before he goes to L.C.<sup><a name="note8" href="#ref8">8</a></sup> Charlie has means to meet his
                expenses his income is much more but his expenses are very much more he thinks or
                has talks a great deal of my going home almost ever since I been in the country I
                have packed my trunk once to go I cannot help being so much expence to him and am sure I would rather not live in this way I have no appetite
                and shall probably not go down to day Charlie has gone to Southerland Falls<sup><a name="note9" href="#ref9">9</a></sup>, I have not been happy I
                could not be, because Charlie has not been kind perhaps he will be better I know he
                cannot be more unkind than he has been almost ever since I have been in the country
                one gets weary of being found fault with always still I dont know where I should go or do without him I should not have remained in the
                country if I could have helped it I could not do any thing else I could only go home
                he says enough of this dear Mother its better to look on the bright side Charlie has not been unkind to day I do not write with my mind agitated and I do not immagine things and I do not exaggerate I have one comfort he cant be much worse than he has been if theres any change he must be better, he has been once to Southerland Falls but

                would be too much pleasure for me to have this house is rather superior in many

                    subscribers to belong to its organization each year, and at the end of the year
                    a drawing would be held. Winners would receive original works of art that the
                    Art Union had purchased. More than likely Heyde charged a nominal fee for the
