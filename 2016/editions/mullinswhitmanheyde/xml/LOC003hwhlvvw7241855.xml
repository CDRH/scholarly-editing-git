The year 1855 is confirmed by the events mentioned in the letter, especially Hannah's references to the trip from Rutland to Clarendon Springs.  Hannah dated this letter as Wednesday July 24, but Wednesday fell on July 25 in 1855.  So in this case the day of the week &#8212; Wednesday &#8212; probably supersedes the numerical day; this letter can thus be dated July 25, 1855.</note>

            <p>we do not hear a word from any of you I think if you was sick some of them would send me word I have been wishing and expecting to hear from you every day we shall be here some days longer. I wish some of you would write a line or two. I am very anxious I am so afraid you are sick, I am not very well myself my appetite is not good at all not being very strong any trouble knocks me up completely I want very much to see you &#40;a lady boarder in the house, <hi rend="underline">Mother</hi> &#41; came to see her yesterday I quite envied her I dont know or speak to anyone in the house, this <choice><sic>ladies</sic><corr>lady's</corr></choice> husband indulges her he will hardly let her walk down stairs I have only seen her down once he has her meals sent up she is quite humored enough and I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> think needed her mother as much as I do&#41; &#8212;Mother dear perhaps my writing about such trifles will take your mind a little I wish it could, do you ever wonder Mother how I am getting along you have enough other things to think of and enough other trouble. I do hope you feel somewhat reconciled and cheerful by this time I know by myself <choice><sic>ones</sic><corr>one's</corr></choice> mind affects the body so very much <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> get sick dear Mother, I am afraid I write rather <choice><sic>meloncholy</sic><corr>melancholy</corr></choice>, I ought to write more cheerfully, but you know I cannot disguise my feelings very much I do not feel cheerful, if I could have seen and spoken to Father I am afraid I make you feel bad Mother I have no one here to speak to, I expect the boys all try to appear cheerful and would not like my writing what would renew your grief <pb facs="LOC003hwhlvvw7241855.02.jpg"/>a little time makes much difference with me &#8212; </p>
            <p>I wish some of you would write immediately before we leave here I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know how long we shall be here did you get that line I wrote the day we came here. I was very sick and miserable that day but I rode from Clarendon Springs<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">Clarendon Springs, a small village southwest of Rutland, was known for its natural spring water.</note> here, &#40;six or seven miles&#41; in an open wagon very <choice><sic>ruff</sic><corr>rough</corr></choice> stony road. I would liked its being <choice><sic>ruff</sic><corr>rough</corr></choice> once but my side is weak it hurt me some, once so I almost screamed our being there was very expensive and unpleasant for me but Charlie liked it &#40;they generally come down to Rutland<note xml:id="n3" type="editorial" resp="jse">Rutland, a major stop on the Rutland Railroad, is five miles from Clarendon Springs.</note> in a Coach they had hired it to a party for that day. Charlie paid half a dollar each for our riding here in that unpleasant &#40;for me&#41; manner, and &#36;2, 50 cents for our being taken down our <choice><sic>expences</sic><corr>expenses</corr></choice> there was &#36;1.50 each a day besides other little things, here our <choice><sic>expences</sic><corr>expenses</corr></choice> are &#36;2, each a day <choice><sic>thats is</sic><corr>that is</corr></choice> what we expect,&#41; Dear Mother I speak of all these little things to take your mind, <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice> possible we may remain here in Rutland some weeks I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know where we shall go next early in September Charlie is going to Lake Champlain<note xml:id="n4" type="editorial" resp="jse">Lake Champlain is one of the largest freshwater lakes in the United States.

Baxter attended law school and passed the bar in 1832, but never practiced law; he focused on investments and real estate. He lived in the Potwin-Winterbotham House on Willard Street in Burlington, a rambling 20-room yellow brick house.  See David J.

The Art Union would charge subscribers to belong to its organization each year, and at the end of the year a drawing would be held.  Winners would receive original works of art that the Art Union had purchased.  More than likely Heyde charged a nominal fee for the tickets he sold.  See William H.
