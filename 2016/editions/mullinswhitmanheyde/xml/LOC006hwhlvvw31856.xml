Hannah’s uncertainty about where Mother Whitman would be living may be attributed to a series of real estate purchases that Walt Whitman made between May 1855 and May 1856.  On May 24, 1855 Walt purchased a home on Ryerson Street in Brooklyn; only Louisa’s name was listed on the deed to the house. Walt purchased another house for his mother on the corner of Graham Street and Willoughby Avenue in April 1856; the family moved to 77 Classon Avenue in May 1856.
