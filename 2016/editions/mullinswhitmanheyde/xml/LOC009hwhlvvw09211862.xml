The day and the year are in Richard Maurice Bucke’s handwriting.  The date, September 21, 1862, is probably accurate. September 21 fell on Sunday in 1862. Hannah refers to Heyde’s painting trip to Ottawa, which took place in Autumn 1862.</note>

Although his practice was general medicine, his specialty was surgery, and he performed numerous amputations. Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Vermont from 1854 to 1871, during the Civil War he served as Surgeon General of Vermont. See H.

In the mid 1850s this medical condition would have been treated with “mechanical contrivances,” with “bichloride of mercury” or with “the administration of saline asperients.” Charles West, <hi rend ="italic">Lectures on the Diseases of Women: Part I – Diseases of the Uterus </hi> &#40;London: John Churchill, 1856&#41;, 220.  If Hannah was prescribed doses of mercury, she probably suffered from chronic severe headaches and insomnia.</note> I know I shall get well soon dear Mother I have said many times if George was only safe I would not complain, let me know dear Mother just as soon as you hear &#8211; I get along nicely here alone do not feel the least anxious about me. &#8211; I cannot think of anything now but about George.</p>

Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Mannahatta (“Hattie”), born on June 9, 1860, and Jessie Louisa, born on June 17, 1863.

Like his father and brothers, Andrew was a carpenter; he served in the Union Army briefly during the Civil War. See Martin G.

Hannah refers to their marriage in her 1852 letter to Mother Whitman. Nancy and Andrew had two children; Hannah suggests the name “George” for their second child, which they apparently accepted.  Their child was called “Georgy.”
