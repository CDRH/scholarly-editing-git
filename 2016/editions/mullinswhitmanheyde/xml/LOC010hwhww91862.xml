<p>Dear Brother<note xml:id="n1" type="editorial" resp="jse">This letter dates to September 1862.
Hannah uses similar paper in a letter to Mother Whitman dated September 21, 1862 by Richard Maurice
Bucke: on that letter the date "21 1862" is in Bucke's handwriting; "from sister Han," written on the
back of page two of this letter, is in Bucke's handwriting. Hannah's concerns about George are
evident in both letters; probably Hannah wrote both letters on the same day, and may have
enclosed her letter to her brother in the letter to Mother Whitman. Both letters have the same
number of crease marks on them, indicating that they may have been placed in the same envelope.
Her letter to Walt, however, does not have the jagged edge that her letter to Mother Whitman
possesses; it appears that Hannah may have cut the edge off of the letter to Walt.</note>
&#8212; Is George <note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">George Washington Whitman
&#40;1829&#8211;1901&#41;, the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman, and ten years younger than Walt. George
learned to read and write as a pupil under his older brother Walt (who briefly served as a
schoolteacher in Long Island), and worked as a carpenter prior to his military service during the
Civil War.</note> safe, Will you telegraph to me immediately if you have any good news. I would
telegraph home, I think I am well enough to get out I saw a name in the paper last night at first I
&#8212; &#8212; afterwards I see it was a different company and I hope a different division. <choice>
<sic>Georges</sic>
<corr>George's</corr>
</choice> company is company D <note xml:id="n3" type="editorial" resp="jse">George initially
enlisted in the Thirteenth New York State Militia soon after Fort Sumter in the spring of 1861, and
was sent to Washington D.C. When his three month enlistment was over, he re-enlisted, this time with
the 51st New York Volunteers in the fall of 1861, Company D., as Hannah notes. Hannahs concern is
justified: Georges regiment was involved in the Second Battle of Bull Run &#40;August 28&#8211;30&#41;; the Battle
of Chantilly &#40;September 1&#41;; the Battle of South Mountain &#40;September 14&#8211;15&#41;; and Antietam &#40;Sept
17&#41;.</note> this was B. and Kings division. I have a hope, I am almost sure &#8212; because the <choice>
<abbr>Reg't</abbr>
<expan>Regiment</expan>
</choice> was not mentioned, &#8212; I shall wait anxiously <choice>
<sic>untill</sic>
<corr>until</corr>
</choice> I can hear, I feel quite sure this morning, it was no one belonging to me. You must
forgive me for <choice>
<sic>troubleing</sic>
<corr>troubling</corr>
</choice> you when I know you at home all feel just as anxious I <hi rend="underline">feel for
you</hi> but I think perhaps you have heard good news by this time, perhaps I am anxious needlessly
I have no doubt I am, &#8212; perhaps brother George has written to Mother by this time, and you
will almost vexed at me for feeling so, but I am alone, have been some sick, but I am not so weak,
as you think, I can bear a good deal I shall be hopeful and cheerful; I feel George is safe, I
expect dear brother you will think me easily agitated or frightened do not let me trouble you. Give
my <hi rend="underline">love</hi> to <hi rend="underline">dear Mother</hi>, I wish I could see her I
shall soon, my love to you,</p>
