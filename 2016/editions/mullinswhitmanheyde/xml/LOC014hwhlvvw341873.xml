            <p>I have been writing a line or two to Walt, so I thought I would ask you how you are and how Walt is. I have nothing else particularly to write about, and I am always glad to hear from home</p>
         <p>Everything here is just the same. the neighbors run in and see me sometimes as usual I have not felt like going out, I am well perfectly only some anxious to hear from home, I would be glad to see you and Lou<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (1842-1892), known as “Lou,” married George Whitman on April 14, 1871. They moved to Camden in 1872, and Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873-1884.

George learned to read and write as a pupil under his older brother Walt (who briefly served as a schoolteacher in Long Island), and worked as a carpenter prior to his military service during the Civil War.  When the war ended, he became a pipe inspector for the City of Camden and the New York Metropolitan Water Board. See Martin G. Murray, “Whitman, George Washington,” <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</hi>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         I have meant mother to write again to Lou, that note I sent her was a poor return for her very kind letter. &#8212;</p>

Walt’s favorite brother, Jeff played the piano and had a lively sense of humor.  He married Mattie Emma Mitchell on February 23, 1859. Jeff and Mattie moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867 Jeff accepted a position as Chief Engineer and Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis, Missouri.</note> yet dear mother, and the children too. dear little girls<note xml:id="n5" type="editorial" resp="jse">	Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta (“Hattie”), born on June 9, 1860, and Jessie Louisa, born on June 17, 1863.</note>. I love them very much indeed. A while ago Walt sent me a letter Hattie had written him, &#8212; I was very nice and smart. &#8212; I think they are much smarter than other children.</p>
            <p>I have not heard how Walt was since he wrote me about dear sister <choice><sic>Marthas</sic><corr>Martha's</corr></choice> death, he wrote the 21 Feb,</p>

            <p>You must take good care of yourself dear Mother</p>
