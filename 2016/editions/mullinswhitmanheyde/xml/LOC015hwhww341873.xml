<p>How are you this morning<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>?</corr></choice> &#8212; I wish I was where I could come in and see you and do something for you &#8212; that has been a trouble to us, that we 
<choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> be of the least benefit to you now when you are ill<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">Whitman suffered a paralytic stroke on January 
23, 1873.  His friends in Washington, DC helped to care for him: John Burroughs, Peter Doyle, and Ellen O'Connor.  See his letters to Mother Whitman dated January 26, 27, 29, and 31, 1873, in which 
he describes his illness and gradual recovery &#40;<hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman Archive</hi>&#41;.</note></p>
<p>You dont know anything about how bad and sorry I felt about your illness </p> <p> you have been exceedingly kind and thoughtful dear brother to write to me, that first letter was very welcome I was 
    wonderfully glad to get it, a little afraid you was hardly yet strong enough <pb facs="LOC015hwhww341873.02.jpg"/>to write. &#8212; Dear Mother too has been kind about writing I expect a line every day I am anxious to hear. I have not 
heard for eleven days &#8212; I do so hope to hear the good news that you are better, and are able to go out a little</p>
<p>I feel glad when its bright pleasant weather I think maybe you will gain faster, &#8212; I know my dear brother you have a good deal of patience and that you do not easily get discouraged and that 
    too is in your <choice><sic>favour</sic><corr>favor</corr></choice>. &#8212; You have a good many friends I know, and have every attention, every little thing <pb facs="LOC015hwhww341873.03.jpg"/>done for your comfort that can be done, do you not 
Walt. &#8212; Still it would seem better, to us, if some of us was near you.</p>
<p>Has George<note xml:id="n3" type="editorial" resp="jse">George Washington Whitman &#40;November 29, 1829-December 20, 1901&#41; was the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman, and ten years younger 
than Walt.  George learned to read and write as a pupil under his older brother Walt &#40;who briefly served as a schoolteacher in Long Island&#41;, and worked as a carpenter prior to his military service 
during the Civil War.  When the war ended, he became a pipe inspector for the City of Camden and the New York Metropolitan Water Board. See Martin G. Murray, "Whitman, George Washington," in <hi rend="italic">Walt 
Whitman: An Encyclopedia</hi>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings &#40;New York: Garland, 1998&#41;,777-78.</note> been to see you I suppose he has though</p>
<p>And dear brother Jeffy<note xml:id="n4" type="editorial" resp="jse">Thomas Jefferson Whitman &#40;1833-1890&#41;, "Jeff," was the eighth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman. Walt's favorite brother, Jeff 
played the piano and had a lively sense of humor.  He married Mattie Emma Mitchell on February 23, 1859. Jeff and Mattie moved in with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage.  In 1867 Jeff accepted 
a position as chief engineer and superintendent of waterworks in St. Louis, Missouri.</note> too I know as soon as he can think of anything he will go to see you. I should like to hear from him and the 
dear little girls<note xml:id="n5" type="editorial" resp="jse">Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta &#40;"Hattie"&#41;, born on June 9, 1860, and Jessie Louisa, born on June 17, 1863.</note></p>
<p>Do you remember Walt some years ago, what a bad time I had with my back &#40;I think it was <choice><sic>neuralgie</sic><corr>neuralgia</corr></choice> of the spine&#41; anyway I was well only my back I could 
not walk three steps for many weeks &#38; could sit up all day, &#38; when I could walk about &#38; even go up &#38; down stairs I was a good deal more than half bent over &#38; I was bent over so nearly 
as bad for more than a year, &#8212; I only speak of it so you will know how much time will do, my back is now as strong as it ever was in the world.<pb facs="LOC015hwhww341873.04.jpg"/> I do so want you to get well Walt, I shall be so happy 
when you are strong as ever again, and persons tell me you will be, a good many inquire about you. &#8212;</p>
<p>You know your room here is always ready. I do hope when it warm weather in June you will come. I remember you liked the mountain air here and I know it will be good for you   And I have been thinking 
if dear Mother too could bear the journey, for it would seem just like to home to you then, and I do not think it safe to stay in Washington like you did last summer, &#38; Charlie has a great wish to go away 
to the Adirondacks<note xml:id="n6" type="editorial" resp="jse">The Adirondacks, a mountain range in northeast New York State,  border Lake Champlain on its west side, and can be seen from Burlington 
looking southwest across the lake.</note> &#38; other places, &#38; it's a great bother to leave the house alone with me, &#38; I would do everything in my power for you dear brother I 
<choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know why I have not written to you before, I wish I had something cheerful to tell you, things are just the same here I only want you to be well again I do 
like that young fellow that is so kind to you, Peter Doyle<note xml:id="n7" type="editorial" resp="jse">Peter George Doyle &#40;1843-1907&#41;, was Walt Whitman's companion and lover.  Their relationship began 
in 1865 when Whitman met Doyle, a streetcar conductor, and continued until Whitman's death in 1892.  Doyle was born in Limerick, Ireland, emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of eight, 
and served in the Confederate Army for eighteen months during the Civil War.  See Martin G. Murray, "Pete the Great: A Biography of Peter Doyle," in <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</hi> 12 &#40;Summer 
1994&#41;: 1-51.</note> I shall always remember him</p>
