to write to me. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what I should have done without, &#8212; your letters done me good,</p>
<p>I want to ask you dear brother to try to not <choice><sic>greive</sic><corr>grieve</corr></choice>. I do wish you would try to not. 
    <choice><sic>when</sic><corr>When</corr></choice> dear Mother was here she said that sometimes <pb facs="LOC016hwhww771873.02.jpg"/>she felt bad to think we all thought so much of her, for at most she 
could not be with us a great while</p>
<p>We all seem, Eddy<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">	Eddy &#40;Edward&#41; Whitman &#40;1835-1892&#41;, the youngest child of Louisa and Walter Whitman, was

Haslam Whitman.  Walt Whitman contributed to his support.  Eddy was placed in an asylum in Blackwood, New Jersey, in 1888.</note> and all, to depend upon you so much, 
and next to dear mother you are the very dearest to me, &#8212;</p>
<p>I know that just as long as you live you will miss dear Mother: and so shall I.</p>
<p>And you have always done every single thing possible for <choice><sic>Mothers</sic><corr>Mother's</corr></choice> comfort, for when dear Mother was here she said 
    you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> one she could <pb facs="LOC016hwhww771873.03.jpg"/>always rely on.</p>
<p>I shall expect you to stay here this Summer <hi rend="underline">all the time you have</hi>  from your business in Washington, it will not do for 
you to be there in the hot weather like you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> last Summer,</p>
