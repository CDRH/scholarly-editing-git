<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>I wish I had written to you before, but first I could not, I wanted <choice><sic>too</sic><corr>to</corr></choice></p>
<p>Now I feel anxious to write. I am <choice><sic>gratefull</sic><corr>grateful</corr></choice> for your being so thoughtful and unselfish in your own great grief, 
to write to me. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what I should have done without, &#8212; your letters done me good,</p>
<p>I want to ask you dear brother to try not to <choice><sic>greive</sic><corr>grieve</corr></choice>. I do wish you would try to not. 
    <choice><sic>when</sic><corr>When</corr></choice> dear Mother was here she said that sometimes <pb facs="LOC016hwhww771873.02.jpg"/>she felt bad to think we all thought so much of her, for at most she

Haslam Whitman.  Walt Whitman contributed to his support.  Eddy was placed in an asylum in Blackwood, New Jersey, in 1888.</note> and all, to depend upon you so much, 
and next to dear mother you are the very dearest to me, &#8212;</p>
<p>I know that just as long as you live you will miss dear Mother: and so shall I.</p>
<p>And you have always done every single thing possible for <choice><sic>Mothers</sic><corr>Mother's</corr></choice> comfort, for when dear Mother was here she said 
    you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> one she could <pb facs="LOC016hwhww771873.03.jpg"/>always rely on.</p>
<p>I shall expect you to stay here this Summer <hi rend="underline">all the time you have</hi> your vacation and from your business in Washington, it will not do for 
you to be there in the hot weather like you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> last Summer,</p>
<p>I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what I should do if you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> not

<p>I only hope you will be comfortable and at home here, and I know you will</p>
        <p>So make your arrangements to stop here all the time you have, <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice> the weather is as pleasant here as anywhere <pb facs="LOC016hwhww771873.04.jpg"/> and I will 
like to have you here, it <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> make a straws difference in my housework I was so glad to hear that you

<p>Everything of dear <choice><sic>Mothers</sic><corr>Mother's</corr></choice> is sacred, &#8212; I have not seen dear <choice><sic>Mothers</sic><corr>Mother's</corr></choice>
hair yet, and the <gap reason="illegible"/>, I have stood dear <choice><sic>Mothers</sic><corr>Mother's</corr></choice> death a great deal better that I would have thought 
I possibly could I have been working all the past week Dear Brother I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> write much this time, do be careful of yourself &#38; 
do try to not grieve, I am pretty well, but I feel as if I <hi rend="underline"> could not</hi> bear any more I am sorry I have not written to before,</p>
