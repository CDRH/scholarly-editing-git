    <date when="1881-11">Sunday Evening, Nov. [1881]</date><note xml:id="n1" type="editorial" resp="jse">This letter is dated 1881 in Richard Maurice Buckes handwriting.  
This date is confirmed because it concurs with the publication of Whitmans sixth and final edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, with the publication 
of Whitmans poem The Sobbing of the Bells in the Boston <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, and with Whitmans visit to West Hills, Long Island, all mentioned by Hannah 
in this letter</note>

<salute>Dearest Brother</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your Book<note xml:id="n2" type="editorial" resp="jse">The sixth and final edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, published in August 1881, known as 
the Deathbed edition, included twenty-two new poems. Whitman travelled to Boston in late August to oversee the proofs; while there, he visited twice with Emerson.</note>
came last night. I was just delighted. I prize it greatly. I shall always keep this one, every single one of the others are gone, the last one you sent Charlie also, 
he lent them to his friends, and <choice><sic>thats</sic><corr>that's</corr></choice> the last of them. I said last night that this one does not go out of this house 
under any consideration as long as I live.</p>
<p><choice><sic>Dont</sic><corr>Don't</corr></choice> you think <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice> got up finely, I do. It will be successful, many speak 
of it here. We looked it over all the evening. Charlie taking it, then I, he read aloud (appreciatively) the Song of Myself. I wanted to read the Ox Tamer<note xml:id="n3" type="editorial" resp="jse">
"The Ox-Tamer," a poem by Whitman, was to be included in the 1860 <hi rend="italic">Banner at Daybreak,</hi> but the book was never published because the publishers, Thayer and Eldridge, failed.  
The poem was included in subsequent editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass.</hi> See Gay Wilson Allen,<hi rend="italic">The Solitary Singer,</hi>267.</note> and others I 
    liked. There is something so touching or affecting <pb facs="LOC017hwhww111881.02.jpg"/>in the words, or title, Sobbing of the Bells,<note xml:id="n4" type="editorial" resp="jse">The Sobbing of the 
Bells, written after the assassination (July 2, 1881) and death of President Garfield (Sept 19, 1881), was published in the Boston <hi rend="italic">Daily Globe</hi> 
on September 27, 1881, and included in the 1881 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. See Jerome Loving, <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself</hi> 
(Berkeley: U of California P, 1999) 409.</note> (you know you sent the Boston Globe), we were so taken with &#38; glad to get read the rest of the poem. Charlie sits here 
reading your book, he says this book is <choice><sic>electrick</sic><corr>electric</corr></choice>. You <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> 
<choice><sic>immagine</sic><corr>imagine</corr></choice> Walt how many speak of you to me. I believe <choice><sic>every body</sic><corr>everybody</corr></choice> under the 
sun knows of you, even persons that live far back in the Country. The other day a Lady friend Mrs. Barney called, that lives back among the Richmond hills, away from any 
village, among other things she spoke of a full length picture of you having been painted for a German Club out West, all have something so say of you that is pleasant for 
me to hear.</p>
<p>Some want to see me, Walt <choice><sic>Whitmans</sic><corr>Whitman's</corr></choice> sister. I have not begun to put on airs yet, but I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don''t</corr></choice> 
    know but I shall soon</p><pb facs="LOC017hwhww111881.03.jpg"/>
<p>I was pleased with Mr. Luce a Wisconsin Editor that called some months since, he has sent us several of his papers, most all speak of you. I 
<choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know that you would care for it, but I will send you the first one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Abbot an old, very intelligent friend that called yesterday, that we had not seen for twelve years used to live here, wanted your new book should purchase it here, if 
she could, or wait till she arrived in Boston. I said I would tell you that she wanted you very much to visit her at their farm among the mountains, spoke of many things she 
would do for you if you would come. I told her you had promised to come here some time.</p>
<p>Walt, I am ashamed I did not write last spring when you sent me that money. <hi rend="underline">You</hi> understand how much I do appreciate it. For a day or two I could 
    only think how <hi rend="underline">good</hi> you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice>. &#8212; And then I never in all my life <pb facs="LOC017hwhww111881.04.jpg"/>had money that done me so much good. 
I have some of it yet. I saved to finish out a dress I wanted for this Winter, this dress will be all that I shall need. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know 
whatever I should do without you Walt, in many ways always some pleasant <choice><sic>supprise</sic><corr>surprise</corr></choice>, a paper or a magazine, letter, something  or 
other, all so pleasant to get. Life would be dull without you.</p>
<p>That West Hill letter<note xml:id="n5" type="editorial" resp="jse"> West Hill letter: Whitman must have written a letter (now lost) to Hannah about his visit to West Hills, 
near Huntington, Long Island, from July 29-August 1, 1881.  Whitman described the impact of seeing West Hills again in a letter to Harry Stafford dated August 20, 1881,: I was 
down on Long Island at the spot where I was born where I had spent my summers in youth from time to time &#8212; went around to all the old places I hadnt seen  before for forty 
years &#8212; seems to me now the most beautiful region on earth (Walt Whitman Archive).</note> I think perhaps I know more of those places you describe than the rest of the family, 
so to me it was <hi rend="underline">more than <choice><sic>interresting</sic><corr>interesting</corr></choice></hi>, something to keep. Charlie wrote a pleasant letter to Dr. 
Bucke,<note xml:id="n6" type="editorial" resp="jse">Richard Maurice Bucke (1837-1901), Medical Doctor and Head of the Asylum for the Insane in Ontario Canada, was a friend of Walt 
Whitmans.  In 1867, Bucke read Whitmans poetry for the first time and became a devoted follower; he visited Whitman in Camden in 1877. He wrote a biography of Whitman in 1883, and 
was one of Whitmans literary executors after Whitmans death in 1892.</note> Canada, got a kind letter in reply, spoke of you &#38; he taking dinner together in New York, but the 
    best was that you was pretty well. Your Nov. 1st letter too, said you was well as usual. I am so glad, after all the work and worry you must have had</p><pb facs="LOC017hwhww111881.05.jpg"/>
<p>sometimes we take long walks in the country, we went to day, a mile or so.</p>
<p>Charlie has been sketching some this summer at Williston<note xml:id="n7" type="editorial" resp="jse">Williston, Vermont, a village south and east of Burlington. One of Heydes 
favorite places for painting was the Winooski River, which skirts the north side of Williston. At the time of this letter (1881), Willistons population was 1,342 (US Dicennial 
Census, United States Census Bureau, retrieved July 29, 2015).</note> 18 or 20 miles from here, we drove out there two weeks ago, the country was beautiful, I liked the ride 
<hi rend="underline">ever</hi> so much</p>
<p><choice><sic>he</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> has sent his Williston picture West, he thinks it sold, he will know soon. He sold one there previous for $78, has just now sold a 
small one $16. <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> has some prospects. We have ups &#38; downs, like <choice><sic>every body</sic><corr>everybody</corr></choice>. He sold 
more years ago, than late years. I think his pictures much better now, people here follow the fashion, buy foreign pictures. I am well, I feel better than I did last summer, I worry 
less if things go cross ways. Dear dear brother I hope to live long enough to see you again. I want you to come here, more than I can say,</p><pb facs="LOC017hwhww111881.06.jpg"/>
<p><choice><sic>if</sic><corr>If</corr></choice> you should build that little house Walt you used to speak of, I <choice><sic>shant</sic><corr>shan't</corr></choice> forget that old invitation. 
I am sorry <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it's</corr></choice> so late, I <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> write to Lou,<note xml:id="n10" type="editorial" resp="jse">Louisa Orr 
Haslam Whitman (1842-1892) married George Whitman on March 14, 1871. They moved to Camden in 1872, and Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873-1884. See Karen Wolfe, Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam

to me. ever so muchlove to you dear Walt &#38; George<note xml:id="n11" type="editorial" resp="jse">George Washington Whitman (1829-1901) was the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman, and 
ten years younger than Walt. George learned to read and write as a pupil under his older brother Walt (who briefly served as a schoolteacher in Long Island), and worked as a carpenter prior to 
his military service during the Civil War.  When the war ended, he became a pipe inspector for the City of Camden and the New York Metropolitan Water Board. See Martin G. Murray, Whitman, George 
Washington, <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</hi>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998),777-778.</note> and Lou, and 
Eddy.<note xml:id="n12" type="editorial" resp="jse">Eddy (Edward) Whitman (1835-1892), the youngest child of Louisa and Walter Whitman, was mentally and physically disabled.  He lived with 
Mother Whitman until her death in 1873, then with his brother George Washington Whitman and his wife Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman.  Walt Whitman contributed to his support.  Eddy was placed in an 
asylum in Blackwood, New Jersey, in 1888.</note> I <choice><sic>good night</sic><corr>Goodnight</corr></choice> Han</p>
<p>What a lovely time you must have had in Boston Walt, socially I mean, your long letter was delightful to get, told me so much, your dinner at <choice><sic>Emersons</sic><corr>Emerson's</corr></choice>
and all the rest. I remember I thought you <choice><sic>was</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> good to think of me. How many good friends you have, it was all just 
<choice><sic>splended</sic><corr>splendid</corr></choice></p>
<p>I like Dr. Bucke, I feel flattered to be ever so little like Mrs. Bucke.</p>
<p>The Burlington Free Press says you are going to Europe this fall, there is no truth in it, is there. I noticed your poem. Song of the Banner at Daybreak,

week in the left hand column of its front page. The issues from autumn 1881 are unavailable, so the exact date of the republication of Whitmans poem cannot be located.</note> a while ago.</p>
<p>With me dear Brother <choice><sic>every thing</sic><corr>everything</corr></choice> goes much the same, new neighbors about us, with one exception, Gen. Henry. I liked the old ones best. 
I run in Mrs. Griswolds, one of our neighbors a good deal, she often speaks of you,</p>
