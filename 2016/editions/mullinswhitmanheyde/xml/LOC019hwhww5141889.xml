Poet and short story writer, OConnor had been approached by the Boston publishers Thayer &#38; Eldridge to write a novel. When Whitman came to Washington, D.C., to find 
his brother George two years later, he stayed with the OConnors and subsequently boarded with them for a few months.  OConnor became one of Whitmans good friends, and 
wrote <hi rend="italics">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</hi> (1866) to defend Whitman when he was fired from his position as a clerk in the Indian Affairs Bureau because 
his supervisor found <hi rend="italics">Leaves of Grass</hi> objectionable.  See Jerome Loving, <hi rend="italics">Walt Whitmans Champion: William Douglas OConnor</hi> 
(College Station, Texas, 1978).</note> he was great and good (his wonderful letter) &#8212; and of Susie Langdon, a clerk, under him in Washington used to tell me about him).
