                        Andrew Lambert for the <i>Oxford Dictionary of
                        National Biography</i>: "Watson, Rundle Burges
                     (1809&#x2013;1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson
                     (1772&#x2013;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant
                     on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and
                     on 24 December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to
                     the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years later,
                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great
                     sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam
                  era."</span></div></div>

                        conveying troops or other equally tame work, as though we were in the field;

                        propitiatory view of the case, but, we say, it is the fact, and although our
                        inclination leads us to think otherwise and to feel dissatisfied with the
                        failure of our dearest hopes, yet, this should not lessen our zeal in the
                        exercise of our various duties, and hope must brighten our path with the
                        expectation, of not always having such unsatisfactory employment.</div>

                        old adage says "better late than never" and who knows, or who can foretell,

                        disappointment.</div>

                        H. M. Stephens, rev. Roger T. Stearn for the
                        <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i>:
                     "Campbell [formerly Macliver], Colin, Baron Clyde (1792&#x2013;1863), army
                     officer, born Macliver, the eldest son of John Macliver (d. 22 December 1858,
                     aged ninety-two), a carpenter in Glasgow&#x2014;whose father's Ardnave estate was
                     forfeited following the Jacobite rising of 1745&#x2014;and his wife,
                     Agnes, née Campbell, of the Campbells of Islay, was born at John Street,
                     Glasgow, on 20 October 1792. His mother died when he was a boy, and her
                     brother, Colonel John Campbell, paid for Colin's education. He attended Glasgow
                     grammar school and Gosport military academy. In 1807 Colonel Campbell took him
                     to the duke of York as candidate for a commission. The duke assumed he was
                     &#x2018;another of the clan&#x2019; and his name was entered as Campbell, which he
                     thenceforth used. [&#x2026;] In March 1857 Campbell was offered command of the
                     expedition then forming for China, which he refused. On 11 July arrived the
                     news of the outbreak of the Indian mutiny and the death of General Anson, the
                     commander-in-chief in India. That day Lord Panmure offered Campbell the
                     command-in-chief. He accepted, and started next day for India. He arrived at
                     Calcutta in August, and heard at once the news of the recovery of Delhi by
                     Major-General Archdale Wilson, and of Havelock's capture of Cawnpore, and his
                     preparations for the first relief of Lucknow. Campbell hurried to Cawnpore the
                     troops intended for the China expedition, which Lord Elgin had wisely sent to
                     Calcutta, and assembled there also picked troops from the army which had taken
                     Delhi. After two months of hard work organizing the troops and clearing Lower
                     Bengal, he took command of the army at the Alambagh, and, leaving General C. A.
                     Windham to hold Cawnpore, started on 9 November with 4700 men and 32 guns to
                     save the British (under Outram and Havelock) at Lucknow. His force, largely
                     European troops&#x2014;and including the 93rd and Captain William Peel's naval
                     brigade&#x2014;reached Lucknow, stormed the sikandarabagh (16 November), then broke
                     through to Outram and Havelock in the residency. Campbell evacuated the Lucknow
                     garrison and its many dependants (11&#x2013;23 November), leaving a force under Outram
                     holding the Alambagh, 3 miles south of Lucknow. On 30 November Campbell reached
                     Cawnpore and sent the rescued on steamers to Calcutta. Meanwhile his success
                     had been endangered by Tantia Topi's defeat of Windham in front of Cawnpore
                     (26&#x2013;8 November), but he arrived in time to prevent further disaster; on 6
                     December he attacked and decisively defeated Tantia Topi, and established his
                     headquarters there. The winter months abounded in minor operations. Campbell
                     decided that a thorough defeat of the mutineers in Oudh must be the first major
                     step towards re-establishing British rule. By March 1858 he had assembled
                     25,000 men for this purpose, and then began his campaign. After ten days' hard
                     fighting he finally recaptured Lucknow on 19 March, and then by a series of
                     operations in Oudh and Rohilkhand pacified&#x2014;with the usual executions and
                     reprisals&#x2014;the north of India by May. He then paused in his own personal
                     exertions from ill health; but it was because of his careful organization that
                     Sir Hugh Rose was able to muster an adequate army for the campaign in central
                     India, and because of his planning that the campaign was finally successful. In
                     India grand strategy was decided, partly on political grounds, by Lord Canning,
                     the governor-general. Influenced by his Crimean experience and wanting to
                     reduce casualties, Campbell's conduct of operations was thorough, cautious, and
                     so relatively slow. Nicknamed Old Kuberdar (&#x2018;take care&#x2019;) and Sir Crawling
                     Camel, he was criticized by some officers&#x2014;and later by Sir John Fortescue&#x2014;as
                     too cautious and slow. Concerned at British casualties from sunstroke, in 1858
                     he ordered that shakos be replaced by sun helmets. As Lord Roberts wrote,
                     &#x2018;there was a feeling throughout the army that Sir Colin was inclined to favour
                     Highlanders unduly&#x2019; (Roberts, 213). At Lucknow he ordered Colonel Ewart of the
                     93rd, &#x2018;Bring on the tartan! Let my own lads at them!&#x2019; (Hibbert, Great Mutiny,
                     340). Campbell made some mistakes: for example, his preventing Outram cutting
                     off the mutineers' retreat after their defeat at Lucknow in March 1858, and his
                     appointment of the notoriously bungling Brigadier-General R. Walpole to command
                     in Rohilkhand. Nevertheless, overall Campbell was a successful commander. The
                     mutiny further enhanced his reputation, and also enriched him by prize money.
                     On 14 May 1858 he was promoted general; on 15 January 1858 he was made colonel
                     of his favourite 93rd highlanders. In late 1858 and early 1859 there was
                     indiscipline among the East India Company's European troops over their transfer
                     to the queen's service. Campbell sympathized with their grievances and advised
                     concession and that the men &#x2018;be liberally dealt with&#x2019; (Maclagan, 243).
                     Initially he was over-ruled, then government policy changed and the crisis
                     ended. Following this &#x2018;white mutiny&#x2019; he told Canning, &#x2018;henceforth it will be
                     dangerous to the State to maintain a European local army&#x2019; (Shadwell, 2.419),
                     and he opposed the establishment of such a force. In June 1861, on the
                     foundation of the order, he was appointed a knight companion of the Order of
                     the Star of India, and on 3 July 1858 he was made Baron Clyde of Clydesdale.
                     His health was failing, and so on 4 June 1860 he left India."</span></div></div>, as well as of a speedy termination to

                        what is the interior? Such were our reflections when we had time to look
                        around us, and witness the busy scene,- boats of various shapes and build,
                        dropping with the tide, with their swarthy crews, and the steersman wrapped
                        in a linen robe, wielding the huge oar with which he guides the boat;
                        magnificent merchant ships laying close in shore for repairs, discharging
                        cargo, or other purposes, the forest of masts which met the gaze when it
                        extended up the river, the hum of distant voices, the strange figures,
                        carriages &amp; vehicles of various descriptions passing along the
                        Esplanade, all united to excite us with their novelty, and we were forced to
                        satisfy our curiosity by visiting the shore.</div>
                    <div class="p">On landing we were assailed by numbers of importunate palanquin
                        bearers, who would hardly listen to the negatives we returned to their
                        vociferations of "Palankie Sail" However we managed to escape in safety, and
                        were pursuing our course towards the town when young lad came forward with
                        an umbrella, and notwithstanding our decisive refusals of his services, he
                        persisted in following and shading us from the sun.</div>

                        acquaintance; he guided us to the bazaars, which reminded us forcibly of the
                        like places for vending goods and merchandize in Constantinople. The small
                        low shops and dirty lanes, for we cannot designate them streets, the various
                        costumes of the natives, yellow, blue, red and white, the most part clothed
                        in little save their tawny skins, all meeting the eye in a variegated mass,
                        as the whole extent of the bazaar was comprehended at a glance, the creaking
                        of the drays, or waggons, drawn by two small buffaloes, and made of bamboos,
                        with most primitive wheels and harness, the shouts of the palanquin bearers,
                        as they staggered under the weight of some corpulent old gentleman, who
                        perhaps, entertained the opinion that the sun might melt him, were he to
                        expose himself; the touting of the vendors, who, with salaams, begged us to
                        walk into, each, his particular shop, and become their customers, all this
                        and many other circumstances which struck us at the time, brought back very

                    <div class="p">After purchasing what we required, and we found that the prices first
                        demanded were high but easily beaten down, we determined to visit now the
                        Esplanade, and see what was going on there. We dismissed our guide with a
                        fee with which he appeared very well pleased, &amp; having refreshed
                        ourselves with an ice at Browne's Hotel, we left our purchases there and
                        strolled forth upon the Esplanade.</div>
                    <div class="p">Here we found Rotten Row, in miniature, whilst upon the green the lovers of
                        exercise amused themselves with cricket, and quoits. The roads were thronged
                        with vehicles &amp; carriages of every description native and European,
                        filled with ladies &amp; gentlemen, enjoying the fresh air; after the sun
                        had expended his power.</div>
                    <div class="p">The complexions of the ladies did not appear to us to have suffered from the
                        heat of the climate, but we suppose they take care not to expose themselves
                        during the day, and thus escape, we could not for one instant entertain an
                        idea of artificial means being resorted to.</div>
                    <div class="p">They certainly appeared to pay as much attention to fashion as in England,
                        but we could not wonder at that, when we saw the immense millinery, and
                        bonnet establishments which with open doors and temptingly displayed head
                        dresses, robes, mantles, &amp;c, &amp;c invited the victims to enter and
                        become an easy prey.</div>
                    <div class="p">The shades of night falling fast and thick, and not wishing to remain any
                        longer on shore, we returned on board, not as well satisfied with Calcutta, at first sight, as
                        we had hoped to be.</div>

                    <h1>Up the Hooghly</h1>
                    <div class="p">On Saturday evening last (Jan 16) although no land was in sight, we found
                        ourselves nearing the channels of the Hooghly. At 6 P.M. we
                        obtained soundings with the deep sea lead and two hours afterwards judging
                        ourselves to be sufficiently near the Pilot station, we anchored for the
                        night in 17 fathoms water, our anchor was again weighed at daylight &amp;
                        about 9 A.M. we passed the first large Buoy that marks the approach to the
                        Eastern channel. At noon we were nearing the Pilot Brig, and the Pilot
                        shortly afterwards came on board. We now ran in till 3 P.M. when the strong
                        tide turning against us, we were again anchored for the night in 7 fathoms
                        water. At Evening Quarters we moved several of the after guns forward to
                        bring the vessel to an even keel: still no land in sight, though the red
                        haze in the Evening horizon seemed to tell of its vicinity.</div>
                    <div class="p">Daylight again found us under way and about 10 A.M. we descried the low banks
                        of the Hooghly,
                        opening on either side of us. With the strong tide in our favor, and our
                        engines working at full power, we now advanced very rapidly; the river banks
                        drew nearer to us; Saugar appeared on our right Kedgereeon our left, with a
                        little cluster of shipping at the anchorage. The water which on the previous
                        day had been of a greenish hue, now became very thick and muddy. Objects on
                        shore now became more distinct as the river lessened in width, the banks
                        were still low &amp; level, not an outline of any distant hills to be seen,
                        here &amp; there a rice plantation varied the jungle Native villages,
                        generally clustered about some creek, where a smaller stream <span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1074.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1074_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1074.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1074.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div> joined the main river, now,
                        and then called our attention. In the stream, we passed many vessels, less
                        favoured than ourselves, taking advantage of the tide to move up the river;
                        others in their downward course, lying at anchor till the tide should turn.
                            <a href="#note4" name="ref4"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span></a> Now we
                        observed traces of the European settler, the tall factory of red brick, the
                        neat white house with green blinds drawn down over the windows, the regular
                        avenue of trees, the cultivated patches of sugar cane, the brick field with
                        piles of bricks, furnished from the dark alluvial clay, of which doubtless,
                        the whole Delta of the Ganges is composed. As we moved swiftly up, the banks
                        of the river glided past like a moving panorama, and the eye could never
                        tire of watching the beautiful scene.</div>
                    <div class="p">At sunset we came to an anchor in the Garden Reach, 2 miles
                        below Calcutta, one or
                        two pretty houses decked the banks, a forest of masts marked the position of
                        the great capital. a deep red tinge, suffused the sky as the sun sank, and
                        was reflected streakily in the ebbing tide, soon darkness came, the river's
                        banks were left to the howling jackal, or the crickets and toads, that made
                        a ceaseless whirring through the watches of the night.</div>

                    <div class="p">It is seldom that any great &amp; unprecedented undertaking will meet with
                        the complete success at the first trial: - the great engineering triumphs of
                        the present century have mostly taught us to expect failure before we
                        achieve success: the Thames Tunnel, the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Plymouth
                        Breakwater, because novel &amp; unexampled works, were therefore in the
                        first instance unsuccessful.</div>
                    <div class="p">It is therefore with no surprize that we heard recently either that the
                        Atlantic Telegraph had failed in the first attempt to lay it down, or that
                        the Great Eastern "refuses to move from the spot where it has been built. A
                        second attempt was made to induce this monster of the deep, to take to its
                        aquatic elements; but a second time, it resisted all arguments whether of
                        force or persuasion.</div>
                    <div class="p">A fair lady bestowed its name, and called it "Leviathan" but
                        "Leviathan was as resolute as "Great Eastern" and still remained upon the
                        shore. "Try again" must be the motto of the builders.</div>
                    <div class="p">Again, we read in an other part of our news that "Big Ben,"-the huge Bell
                        that is to swing in the Clock tower of the Palace of Westminster,-"Big Ben"
                        is cracked, his metal was too thin, or his tongue was too thick, and he will
                        now have to be broken up, and his makers must "Try again" before they bring
                        their work to completion.</div>
                    <div class="p">But all these failures, we say, might reasonably be expected; whenever we
                        attempt anything great and noble and unprecedented, neither a first, nor a
                        second, nor a third failure must daunt us. "Try again" must be our motto,

                        vessel, which we are happy to say was eminently successful, and resulted in
                        the "Leviathan" being gradually lowered down the launching ways some 25 feet
                        in a slow, and beautifully regular manner.</div>

                        regulated according as Mr. Brunel thought fit, with as much care and
                        certainty, as if the vessel had been a little cutter, instead of a ponderous

                    <div class="p">As it was understood that most of the Lucknow people would be
                        present the occasion presented too much interest for us to neglect
                        witnessing it, and partaking in the ceremony.</div>
                    <div class="p">Accordingly at 1/4 to 10 a.m. we left the ship and engaged a buggy at the
                        landing place, into which four of us were speedily stowed: the driver took
                        us through Fort William and we were thus enabled to take a cursory view of
                        the interior.</div>
                    <div class="p">Here we saw several of the native soldiers on guard without any arm save
                        their ramrods, a significant token of the little trust that can be placed
                        upon these men at the present crisis. </div>
                    <div class="p">After leaving the fort we emerged upon the race course, the grand stand &amp;

                        unfortunately missed witnessing, by not reaching this place at an earlier

                    <div class="p">It was not long now ere we arrived at the cathedral, although had it not been
                        for a sharp look out kept on our driver, he would most probably have taken
                        us out into the country, as he did not appear to understand
                        perfectly where we were desirous of being driven to, and was taking a course
                        very different to that we wished. </div>
                    <div class="p">On entering the sacred edifice we found that we were very late, but yet
                        managed to obtain seats, although the position was not good being behind the
                        pulpit.</div>
                    <div class="p">The interior of the building is spacious and airy; the seats are formed of a
                        species of arm chair, thus portioning off to each one a fair space, and even
                        crinoline must share the same as a gentleman of the most slender proportions
                        and consequently no lady could appropriate to herself more room than would
                        be found convenient to a next seat neighbour. We cannot say how the fair sex
                        approve of this arrangement.</div>
                    <div class="p">From the light roof, iron girders dropped, and joined frames of the same
                        material, which ran from one side to the other; we supposed these are

                        every sentence, and carefully peruse every line, receiving fresh pleasure
                        from every perusal, and being borne back in memory to our happy homes, where

                         wishes for our happiness, and welfare; and as we close the pages
                        which have expanded our hearts with more real enjoyment, than we have
                        experienced since we parted from the oft remembered writers, we come back to
                        the cold stern reality of distance, of our separation.</div>
                    <div class="p">But, stop! We have only spoken of pleasure, as derived from the receipt of
                        letters from our homes; there is yet another view of the matter, and, this,
                        brings grief, in lieu of joy; tears, instead of smiles; and sorrow usurps
                        the place of mirth.</div>
                    <div class="p">Note! Some poor comrade receives a letter whose sable edges bespeak the
                        contents; see! with what trembling hand, and bursting heart he retires into
                        some corner, where in secret he can trace with tearful eyes, the lines which
                        convey the sad intelligence of the death of some dear relative, or
                        friend.</div>
                    <div class="p">Tis thus that each mail must produce different emotions amongst a body of
                        men, and while some are filled with joy, others are drooping with
                        pain and trouble.</div>

                        Tigers.</h1>
                    <div class="p">As we believe that many of our readers have availed themselves of our
                        recommendation last week to ascend the Monument on the Esplanade, we will
                        venture to call attention in like manner to the beautiful Lucknow tigers which may be
                        seen on the payment of one Rupee in Wood Street, Chowringhee.</div>
                    <div class="p">They have been lately brought from Lucknow, where they formed a portion of the Royal Menagerie
                        which the Kings of Oude have been in the habit of maintaining. </div>
                    <div class="p">The first Tiger you see on entering is a beautiful creature most remarkable
                        for its tameness. At Lucknow it had been brought up by hand, and led about with
                        only a chain round its neck. It would allow little children to play with it
                        in passing along the streets, and the people of Lucknow lamented when they
                        saw it put into a cage, to be carried away.</div>
                    <div class="p">There are 6 or 7 others, of which we recollect two particularly, one because
                        of its ferocious growl, the only savage one, and the other as being the
                        largest of all, and distinguished for the beauty of its stripes, which, it
                        will be observed, are all double.</div>
                    <div class="p">There is a leopard, which is rather too apt to put its paws through the cage,
                        and a chetah <span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1093.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1093_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1093.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1093.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div> or
                        hunting leopard, which is only confined by a chain, and seems perfectly
                        tame, licking its keeper's hand, and making a gruff, purring, sound, like a
                        cat with a sore throat.</div>
                    <div class="p">There is also a fine Giraffe, perfectly tame, and we recommend visitors to
                        beg the Sikh attendant to take a ride on its back. The man, though full
                        sized, seems quite a pigmy when mounted on the tall quadruped; and we defy
                        any one to keep himself from laughing, when the poor beast sets off at a
                        canter.</div>

                    <div class="p">Our papers, and our Reviews, our periodicals, have all one absorbing topic,
                        and that is India. Fresh details of the horrible sufferings which our
                        countrymen &amp; women underwent in the earlier part of the insurrection,
                        further particulars of the movements of our gallant army, praises of those
                        heroic spirits who have fought and perchance have fallen, before the gates
                        of Delhi, or within the
                        walls of Lucknow,
                        comments on the past misgovernment of the country, suggestions towards its
                        better management for the future; these seem to form the staple of what we
                        have received by our two last mails; pictorial papers take up the same
                        subject, and views from india, and illustrations of Hindoo customs, now meet
                        us in every page: when we open our Magazines, we find historical papers,
                        tracing the rise of the British dominion in India, dissertations on the
                        variety of races, or essays on the religious, and various forms of feeling
                        which are to be found in this remarkable Asiatic Peninsula.</div>

                        should know, that there are the most terrible details in the background of
                        outrages perpetrated upon English men and English women." </div>
                    <div class="p">"Christianity," writes the same paper in another article, "is not a religion
                        to be propagated by violence, but it is essentially a religion to be
                        diffused by preaching and teaching. Christians may not make converts by the
                        sword, but they are bound, where they can, to make proselytes by instruction
                        *** our administration in India, has presented the spectacle of one of the
                        greatest Christian powers in the world sedulously bent upon ignoring its own
                        belief.**** In future the religion of the dominant race must be plainly
                        professed, instead of being timidly kept in the background, and the field be
                        opened to missionary exertions with the sanction, instead of the disfavour,
                        of the Government."</div>
                    <div class="p">These sentiments, no doubt, express the feelings of the great majority of our
                        friends in England, and we prefer giving them in the powerful words of the
                        "Times," to endeavouring to clothe them in our own poor language.</div>
                    <div class="p">It may be sufficient for us to rejoice that at such a time, we should have
                        been sent in our floating home, to the very spot on which the eyes of the

                        papers so fully describe to our friends at home, and perchance to take part
                        in those transactions, which are yet destined to become matters of
                        history.</div>

                     Alcester (1821&#x2013;1895), naval officer, was born in London on 12 April 1821. He
                     was the son of Colonel Sir Horace Beauchamp Seymour and his first wife,
                     Elizabeth Malet, née Palk (d. 1827), daughter of Sir Lawrence Palk, bt; his
                     grandfather was Lord Hugh Seymour, and his uncle Sir George Francis Seymour. He
                     received his early education at Eton College, and entered the navy in January

                     which he took out to the Crimea, and brought back to Portsmouth in the early
                     summer of 1856. In July 1857 he commissioned the Pelorus, which he commanded
                     for nearly six years on the Australian station. Between January and April 1858
                     the Pelorus provided a naval brigade in Burma, playing a vital role in
                     preventing the spread of the mutiny from India. From 1860 to 1861 he commanded
                     the naval brigade in New Zealand during the war there, for which he was made a

                    <div class="p">Dear Sir,<br></br>The following account which was given me by a gentleman of
                            Calcutta may
                        perhaps, prove interesting <span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1102.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1102_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1102.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1102.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div> to the Readers of the "Young Idea"</div>
                    <div class="p">An exploring party was recently sent from Calcutta to visit the
                            Andaman
                            Islands in the Bay of Bengal with the view of selecting a
                        site to establish a penal colony, and to banish thither the captive King of
                            Delhi and his rebel
                        Sepoys. It is remarkable that this group of Islands, tho' so near to the
                        Asiatic Continent, are inhabited by a race of savages, no way akin to the
                        Asiatic tribes, but apparently much nearer allied to the African Negroes.
                        They live in a perfect state of nature, without the slightest vestige of a
                        garment; their huts are mere dens or kennels under which they crawl at
                        night; in fact they seem to be among the most degraded forms of
                        humanity.</div>
                    <div class="p">The first salutation our explorers received was a flight of arrows, but a few
                        musket shots soon dispersed the natives. Two of them were killed, and one
                        captured. This savage has been brought to Calcutta by Dr. ..... and
                        both he and Mrs...... have done their best to humanize him by kind
                        treatment. He was introduced to several Negroes of different tribes, but
                        none of them could understand his language.</div>
                    <div class="p">He shews himself not insensible to kindness, and was pleased with Dr.
                        .....,'s little child, making signs, that he had a little child also. On one
                        occasion, wishing to show his gratitude to Mrs. ..... &amp; following the
                        custom of his country on such occasions, he took the lady's hand within both
                        his own, raised it solemnly to his lips, and with the deepest respect, spat
                        into it.<br></br><span class="figure"><span class="fig_caption"></span></span></div>

                    <div class="p">The consternation struck into the sepoys in Central India by the sight of our
                        Bluejackets, is scarcely to be imagined. "They are not English "men" say the
                        sepoys. "Nor men, at all, but sea-devils who have come up out of the sea to
                        fight for the Englishmen They do not walk like men, but in a rolling way
                        that shows they have claws upon their feet. They are dressed in a way quite
                        different from Englishmen, they are not tall, but very broad, in fact they
                        are about 5 feet high, by 4 feet broad; they can carry big guns on their
                        shoulders, or under their arms; six of them can bring a gun up a
                        hill, which it would take 200 or 300 sepoys to move at all; they never speak
                        a word, and when they attack they can never be driven back; they are
                        cannibals, and eat sepoys when they have salted them down, sepoy bullets
                        cannot kill them."</div>

                    <div class="p">"Opening of the Siege." The troops mutinied on the 30th of May and after the
                        30th of June the siege commenced in earnest. The constant din of artillery
                        and musketry, combined with the yells of the demons without, and busy
                        excitement within our defences, kept the women and children in dread of
                        death. </div>

                        one side of the room to the other, as the roar of the cannon disturbed them,
                        some prayed as they had never prayed before, while others laughed at the
                        fear &amp; confusion of the rest.</div>

                        by R. H. Vetch, rev. Ainslie T. Embree for the
                        <i>Oxford Dictionary of National
                     Biography</i>"Outram, Sir James, first baronet
                     (1803&#x2013;1863), army officer in the East India Company, second son of Benjamin
                     Outram (bap. 1764, d. 1805), civil engineer and ironmaster, of Butterley Hall,
                     Derbyshire, and his wife, Margaret (1778&#x2013;1863), daughter of Dr James Anderson
                     of Mounie, Aberdeenshire, was born at Butterley Hall on 29 January 1803. [&#x2026;]
                     From 1814 Outram was educated in Aberdeen first at Udny School, then at Mr
                     Esson's school, and finally (in 1818) at Marischal College. In 1819 he received
                     a direct Indian cadetship, sailed for India in May, and arrived in Bombay on 15
                     August. He was temporarily posted to the 4th native infantry, with rank as
                     ensign from 2 May 1819, and then was gazetted a lieutenant in the 1st grenadier
                     native infantry, but was shortly afterwards transferred to the 12th regiment
                     and became acting-adjutant in July 1820. [&#x2026;] For the next fourteen years Outram
                     was engaged in a little-known, but vital, aspect of the establishment of
                     British rule in western India: the subjugation of petty chieftains and tribal
                     peoples in the region known as Khandesh and in the interior of Gujarat. The
                     official reports speak of &#x2018;tribal rebellions&#x2019;, &#x2018;outrages&#x2019; against the British,
                     the lawlessness of marauding bands of tribal peoples, and the refusal of some
                     of the chiefs to accept the new British order. While the contests were unequal,
                     pitting poorly armed and undisciplined groups against the armies of the East
                     India Company, the petty chiefs and the tribal leaders fought tenaciously. [&#x2026;]
                     In July 1853, having been promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel in the
                     preceding month, Outram returned to India, arriving at Calcutta on 12
                     September. While at Calcutta, at the request of the governor-general, he wrote
                     &#x2018;Memorandum on the invasion of India from the westward&#x2019;, which argued that the
                     Indus River should be the western frontier of British India. The court of
                     directors had written to the governor-general to find employment for Outram
                     under the supreme government, and the transfer, towards the end of the year, of
                     Baroda from the Bombay government to the government of India enabled Lord
                     Dalhousie to reinstate Outram as resident there. Outram arrived at Baroda on 19
                     March 1854, and, after holding the office for a month, was appointed political
                     agent and commanded at Aden. He embarked at Bombay in June, but the change to
                     Aden in the hot season affected his health. In November Lord Dalhousie
                     appointed him to the residency of Oudh, and he made his official entry into
                     Lucknow on 5 December. Outram was instructed to prepare at once a report on the
                     condition of the country, and to state whether the improvement demanded by Lord
                     Hardinge seven years previously had in any degree been effected. In March 1855
                     he submitted his report, which represented the condition of Oudh as deplorable,
                     and reluctantly recommended annexation as the only remedy. Annexation took
                     place in February 1856, but with harsher terms for the ruler than Outram had
                     recommended. Outram was promoted major-general on 28 November 1854, and was
                     made KCB in February 1856. Ill health compelled him to return home in May. The
                     Anglo-Persian War, 1857 On 13 November Outram was summoned to India House and
                     informed that he had been appointed to the command of the army for the
                     Anglo-Persian War. Outram was given the local rank of lieutenant-general, and
                     invested with diplomatic powers. He left England at once, and landed at Bombay
                     on 22 December 1856. He left Bombay on 15 January 1857, and arrived at Bushehr
                     on 27 January. The Persian commander-in-chief was at Borazjan, and was
                     collecting a large force there. Outram determined to attack this position and,
                     after a march of 46 miles in forty-one hours, in cold, wet, and stormy weather,
                     the camp was reached, and found to have been hastily abandoned on Outram's
                     approach. Outram commenced his return march on the night of 7 February to
                     Bushehr, carrying with him large stores of provision. On the march, at daybreak
                     on 8 February, they were attacked at Khushab by some 6000 Persians, with a few
                     guns. After a smart action, in which 700 Persians were killed and two guns
                     captured, the Persian force fled. It was not until 26 March that operations
                     were commenced against the Persian stronghold, Muhammarah. The Persians
                     abandoned their position and fled, leaving sixteen guns and all their baggage
                     stores and ammunition behind them. Peace had already been concluded at Baghdad,
                     and the war was at an end. Outram was sent to Baghdad in May to arrange the
                     formation of a mission to see that the evacuation of Herat fortress and
                     district was duly carried out by the Persians. He returned to Bombay on 26 June
                     1857. For his services Outram was made GCB. The Indian mutiny, 1857&#x2013;1858
                     Meanwhile the Indian mutiny had broken out, and Outram's son, who was stationed
                     at Aligarh, and his wife had a narrow escape. Outram reached Calcutta on 31
                     July, and on 8 August was given command of two divisions of the Bengal army
                     occupying the country from Calcutta to Cawnpore inclusive, while he was also
                     made chief commissioner of Oudh in succession to Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence,
                     killed in the defence of Lucknow. He took with him Robert Napier as his
                     military secretary and chief of staff, and arrived at Dinapore on 19 August. On
                     1 September he was at Allahabad, and on 15 September he reached Cawnpore.
                     Outram had already telegraphed from Benares to Havelock that he would shortly
                     join him at Cawnpore with reinforcements, but that he would leave to Havelock
                     the glory of the relief of Lucknow, accompanying him only in his civil capacity
                     as commissioner, and placing his military services at Havelock's disposal as a
                     volunteer. On 28 September Sir Colin Campbell confirmed Outram's temporary
                     transfer of command by a general order, in which he called attention to the
                     disinterested sacrifice made by Outram in favour of Havelock. On 19 September
                     1857 the force crossed the river and marched out of Cawnpore. On 23 September,
                     in the action of the Alambagh, Outram, at the head of the volunteer and native
                     cavalry, pursued the flying enemy to the Charbagh Bridge. On 25 September
                     Havelock's force, after severe fighting, in which Outram received a flesh wound
                     in the arm, won their way to the residency. Outram resumed his military command
                     by a general order on 26 September. He found that he had simply reinforced a
                     beleaguered garrison, and was himself effectually besieged until November, when
                     Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief, came to the rescue. On 12 November
                     Outram, on his side, blew in the outer wall of the garden of the palace of
                     Farid Bakhsh, and opened his batteries on the insurgent defences in front. The
                     buildings were soon in his possession; but he was still half a mile from the
                     most advanced post of Sir Colin Campbell's force, and the way was under the
                     enemy's fire. Outram, however, determined to meet Sir Colin Campbell without
                     delay and, with Havelock and seven others, set out. Four were struck down, but
                     Outram, Havelock, and their surviving companions reached the Moti Mahal unhurt.
                     After a short conference they made their way back. Sir Colin entrusted the
                     withdrawal of the garrison and the evacuation of the residency to Outram. After
                     the evacuation of the residency Campbell left Outram with a field force at the
                     Alambagh position to hold the city of Lucknow until Campbell had placed his
                     convoy in safety and disposed of the Gwalior mutineers. For three months
                     Outram's division, consisting of about 5000 men and 25 guns, kept in check
                     120,000 organized troops with more than 130 guns. The leader of the rebels at
                     Lucknow was the famous Maulvi known as Ahmad Shah. He made determined efforts
                     to sever Outram's communications, and continually harassed his outposts. From
                     the end of December 1857 and through January and February 1858 sharp
                     engagements were fought, in which Outram's troops were successful. The last and
                     most desperate attack was made by the rebels on 25 February, and it was not
                     until dawn the next day that they were completely routed and fell back on
                     Lucknow. On 1 March 1858 Campbell returned to take Lucknow. Outram was placed
                     in command of a large force of picked troops on the north side of the Gumti
                     River, and, crossing the river on 6 March, he pitched his camp near the Fyzabad
                     Road. On 9 March he made his attack, seizing the Chakar Kothi, or yellow house,
                     the key of the enemy's position in that quarter, and, driving the rebels to the
                     river, threw up batteries on its bank to keep down the enemy's fire.
                     The kaisarbagh fell to Sir Colin Campbell on the morning of 14 March. On 16
                     March Outram, having recrossed the Gumti, advanced through the Chattar Manzil
                     and carried the residency. On the morning of 19 March Outram attacked the
                     Musabagh, held by 5000 men and thirteen guns, and carried it, capturing twelve
                     guns. So ended the capture of Lucknow. Last years, 1858&#x2013;1860 Outram was
                     appointed military member of the governor-general's council, and, handing over
                     the charge of Oudh to Robert Montgomery, left Lucknow on 4 April and joined
                     Lord Canning at Allahabad. Many important matters, such as the reorganization
                     of the Indian army, were under consideration during Outram's tenure of office,
                     and he left many wise and carefully prepared minutes recording his views. A
                     baronetcy was conferred upon him by the queen, and the House of Commons voted
                     him an annuity of £1000, to be continued to his immediate successor. On 16 July
                     Outram was promoted lieutenant-general. In October the City of London conferred
                     upon him its freedom and presented him with a sword of honour."</span></div></div> and <div class="showNote"><a href="#" onclick="return false;" class="personNote"> Havelock</a></div><div class="appEntry"><a href="#" class="closenote">X</a></div> came on the 25th September, and we saw the

                        to the bottom of the stream, and the rest running up and down the banks in a

                        <i>Oxford Dictionary of National
                     Biography</i>"Outram, Sir James, first baronet
                     (1803&#x2013;1863), army officer in the East India Company, second son of Benjamin
                     Outram (bap. 1764, d. 1805), civil engineer and ironmaster, of Butterley Hall,
                     Derbyshire, and his wife, Margaret (1778&#x2013;1863), daughter of Dr James Anderson
                     of Mounie, Aberdeenshire, was born at Butterley Hall on 29 January 1803. [&#x2026;]
                     From 1814 Outram was educated in Aberdeen first at Udny School, then at Mr
                     Esson's school, and finally (in 1818) at Marischal College. In 1819 he received
                     a direct Indian cadetship, sailed for India in May, and arrived in Bombay on 15
                     August. He was temporarily posted to the 4th native infantry, with rank as
                     ensign from 2 May 1819, and then was gazetted a lieutenant in the 1st grenadier
                     native infantry, but was shortly afterwards transferred to the 12th regiment
                     and became acting-adjutant in July 1820. [&#x2026;] For the next fourteen years Outram
                     was engaged in a little-known, but vital, aspect of the establishment of
                     British rule in western India: the subjugation of petty chieftains and tribal
                     peoples in the region known as Khandesh and in the interior of Gujarat. The
                     official reports speak of &#x2018;tribal rebellions&#x2019;, &#x2018;outrages&#x2019; against the British,
                     the lawlessness of marauding bands of tribal peoples, and the refusal of some
                     of the chiefs to accept the new British order. While the contests were unequal,
                     pitting poorly armed and undisciplined groups against the armies of the East
                     India Company, the petty chiefs and the tribal leaders fought tenaciously. [&#x2026;]
                     In July 1853, having been promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel in the
                     preceding month, Outram returned to India, arriving at Calcutta on 12
                     September. While at Calcutta, at the request of the governor-general, he wrote
                     &#x2018;Memorandum on the invasion of India from the westward&#x2019;, which argued that the
                     Indus River should be the western frontier of British India. The court of
                     directors had written to the governor-general to find employment for Outram
                     under the supreme government, and the transfer, towards the end of the year, of
                     Baroda from the Bombay government to the government of India enabled Lord
                     Dalhousie to reinstate Outram as resident there. Outram arrived at Baroda on 19
                     March 1854, and, after holding the office for a month, was appointed political
                     agent and commanded at Aden. He embarked at Bombay in June, but the change to
                     Aden in the hot season affected his health. In November Lord Dalhousie
                     appointed him to the residency of Oudh, and he made his official entry into
                     Lucknow on 5 December. Outram was instructed to prepare at once a report on the
                     condition of the country, and to state whether the improvement demanded by Lord
                     Hardinge seven years previously had in any degree been effected. In March 1855
                     he submitted his report, which represented the condition of Oudh as deplorable,
                     and reluctantly recommended annexation as the only remedy. Annexation took
                     place in February 1856, but with harsher terms for the ruler than Outram had
                     recommended. Outram was promoted major-general on 28 November 1854, and was
                     made KCB in February 1856. Ill health compelled him to return home in May. The
                     Anglo-Persian War, 1857 On 13 November Outram was summoned to India House and
                     informed that he had been appointed to the command of the army for the
                     Anglo-Persian War. Outram was given the local rank of lieutenant-general, and
                     invested with diplomatic powers. He left England at once, and landed at Bombay
                     on 22 December 1856. He left Bombay on 15 January 1857, and arrived at Bushehr
                     on 27 January. The Persian commander-in-chief was at Borazjan, and was
                     collecting a large force there. Outram determined to attack this position and,
                     after a march of 46 miles in forty-one hours, in cold, wet, and stormy weather,
                     the camp was reached, and found to have been hastily abandoned on Outram's
                     approach. Outram commenced his return march on the night of 7 February to
                     Bushehr, carrying with him large stores of provision. On the march, at daybreak
                     on 8 February, they were attacked at Khushab by some 6000 Persians, with a few

                     and carried the residency. On the morning of 19 March Outram attacked the
                     Musabagh, held by 5000 men and thirteen guns, and carried it, capturing twelve
                     guns. So ended the capture of Lucknow. Last years, 1858&#x2013;1860 Outram was
                     appointed military member of the governor-general's council, and, handing over
                     the charge of Oudh to Robert Montgomery, left Lucknow on 4 April and joined
                     Lord Canning at Allahabad. Many important matters, such as the reorganization
                     of the Indian army, were under consideration during Outram's tenure of office,
                     and he left many wise and carefully prepared minutes recording his views. A
                     baronetcy was conferred upon him by the queen, and the House of Commons voted
                     him an annuity of £1000, to be continued to his immediate successor. On 16 July
                     Outram was promoted lieutenant-general. In October the City of London conferred
                     upon him its freedom and presented him with a sword of honour."</span></div></div> and <div class="showNote"><a href="#" onclick="return false;" class="personNote">General Havelock</a></div><div class="appEntry"><a href="#" class="closenote">X</a></div> and staff

                        and caps as they neared the Gate; The sight of that gallant little band,

                        the Miner's hoe, which brought down the slip of earth dividing us. The man
                        spread out his arms &amp; screamed as I put the muzzle of my pistol to his
                        breast, and shot him. There was a great noise at the top of the shaft; and
                        they called to each other to go, and bring out the dying miner, and his
                        tools. A Sepoy leapt swearing to the bottom; I shot him in the stomach, in
                        the act of firing at me: the commotion now became louder, and the rebels
                        blustered &amp; swore, as if they were all coming down. I taunted them with
                        cowardice, and they, thinking I was a sikh, upbraided me with associating
                        with "<span class="gap">[indecipherable]</span>"

                        listened civilly to me. I asked why had they mutinied? They replied, they
                        were fighting for their religion. "How have we threatened your religion? By

                        Havildar to come down himself, and then said I would bring him some woman's
                        apparel, this retort caused him to swear, and the others to laugh at him.

                        <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i>:
                     "Campbell [formerly Macliver], Colin, Baron Clyde (1792&#x2013;1863), army
                     officer, born Macliver, the eldest son of John Macliver (d. 22 December 1858,
                     aged ninety-two), a carpenter in Glasgow&#x2014;whose father's Ardnave estate was
                     forfeited following the Jacobite rising of 1745&#x2014;and his wife,
                     Agnes, née Campbell, of the Campbells of Islay, was born at John Street,
                     Glasgow, on 20 October 1792. His mother died when he was a boy, and her
                     brother, Colonel John Campbell, paid for Colin's education. He attended Glasgow
                     grammar school and Gosport military academy. In 1807 Colonel Campbell took him
                     to the duke of York as candidate for a commission. The duke assumed he was
                     &#x2018;another of the clan&#x2019; and his name was entered as Campbell, which he
                     thenceforth used. [&#x2026;] In March 1857 Campbell was offered command of the
                     expedition then forming for China, which he refused. On 11 July arrived the
                     news of the outbreak of the Indian mutiny and the death of General Anson, the
                     commander-in-chief in India. That day Lord Panmure offered Campbell the
                     command-in-chief. He accepted, and started next day for India. He arrived at
                     Calcutta in August, and heard at once the news of the recovery of Delhi by
                     Major-General Archdale Wilson, and of Havelock's capture of Cawnpore, and his
                     preparations for the first relief of Lucknow. Campbell hurried to Cawnpore the
                     troops intended for the China expedition, which Lord Elgin had wisely sent to
                     Calcutta, and assembled there also picked troops from the army which had taken
                     Delhi. After two months of hard work organizing the troops and clearing Lower
                     Bengal, he took command of the army at the Alambagh, and, leaving General C. A.
                     Windham to hold Cawnpore, started on 9 November with 4700 men and 32 guns to
                     save the British (under Outram and Havelock) at Lucknow. His force, largely
                     European troops&#x2014;and including the 93rd and Captain William Peel's naval
                     brigade&#x2014;reached Lucknow, stormed the sikandarabagh (16 November), then broke
                     through to Outram and Havelock in the residency. Campbell evacuated the Lucknow
                     garrison and its many dependants (11&#x2013;23 November), leaving a force under Outram
                     holding the Alambagh, 3 miles south of Lucknow. On 30 November Campbell reached
                     Cawnpore and sent the rescued on steamers to Calcutta. Meanwhile his success
                     had been endangered by Tantia Topi's defeat of Windham in front of Cawnpore
                     (26&#x2013;8 November), but he arrived in time to prevent further disaster; on 6
                     December he attacked and decisively defeated Tantia Topi, and established his
                     headquarters there. The winter months abounded in minor operations. Campbell
                     decided that a thorough defeat of the mutineers in Oudh must be the first major
                     step towards re-establishing British rule. By March 1858 he had assembled
                     25,000 men for this purpose, and then began his campaign. After ten days' hard
                     fighting he finally recaptured Lucknow on 19 March, and then by a series of
                     operations in Oudh and Rohilkhand pacified&#x2014;with the usual executions and
                     reprisals&#x2014;the north of India by May. He then paused in his own personal
                     exertions from ill health; but it was because of his careful organization that
                     Sir Hugh Rose was able to muster an adequate army for the campaign in central
                     India, and because of his planning that the campaign was finally successful. In
                     India grand strategy was decided, partly on political grounds, by Lord Canning,
                     the governor-general. Influenced by his Crimean experience and wanting to
                     reduce casualties, Campbell's conduct of operations was thorough, cautious, and
                     so relatively slow. Nicknamed Old Kuberdar (&#x2018;take care&#x2019;) and Sir Crawling
                     Camel, he was criticized by some officers&#x2014;and later by Sir John Fortescue&#x2014;as
                     too cautious and slow. Concerned at British casualties from sunstroke, in 1858
                     he ordered that shakos be replaced by sun helmets. As Lord Roberts wrote,
                     &#x2018;there was a feeling throughout the army that Sir Colin was inclined to favour
                     Highlanders unduly&#x2019; (Roberts, 213). At Lucknow he ordered Colonel Ewart of the
                     93rd, &#x2018;Bring on the tartan! Let my own lads at them!&#x2019; (Hibbert, Great Mutiny,
                     340). Campbell made some mistakes: for example, his preventing Outram cutting
                     off the mutineers' retreat after their defeat at Lucknow in March 1858, and his
                     appointment of the notoriously bungling Brigadier-General R. Walpole to command
                     in Rohilkhand. Nevertheless, overall Campbell was a successful commander. The
                     mutiny further enhanced his reputation, and also enriched him by prize money.
                     On 14 May 1858 he was promoted general; on 15 January 1858 he was made colonel
                     of his favourite 93rd highlanders. In late 1858 and early 1859 there was
                     indiscipline among the East India Company's European troops over their transfer
                     to the queen's service. Campbell sympathized with their grievances and advised
                     concession and that the men &#x2018;be liberally dealt with&#x2019; (Maclagan, 243).
                     Initially he was over-ruled, then government policy changed and the crisis
                     ended. Following this &#x2018;white mutiny&#x2019; he told Canning, &#x2018;henceforth it will be
                     dangerous to the State to maintain a European local army&#x2019; (Shadwell, 2.419),
                     and he opposed the establishment of such a force. In June 1861, on the
                     foundation of the order, he was appointed a knight companion of the Order of
                     the Star of India, and on 3 July 1858 he was made Baron Clyde of Clydesdale.
                     His health was failing, and so on 4 June 1860 he left India."</span></div></div>
                        and imparted to him my desire to venture in disguise in his company My
                        attire was soon completed; I was dressed as a Budmash, or Irregular soldier
                        of the city, with sword and shield, native made shoes, tight trousers, a
                        yellow silk koortah over a close fitting white muslin shirt, a yellow
                        coloured chintz sheet thrown round my shoulders, a cream coloured turban,
                        and a white waistband or "Kummerbund", My face and neck down to the
                        shoulders, and my hands to the wrists, were coloured with lampblack, the
                        cork used being dipped in oil to cause the colour to adhere. After being
                        provided with a small double barrelled pistol, and a pair of broad pyjamahs
                        over the tight trousers, I proceeded with Kunrigee Lall to the banks of the
                            river
                        Goomtee. We undressed and quickly forded the river, which was
                        about 4 1/2 ft. deep, and about 100 yards wide at this point. My courage
                        failed me while in the water, and if my guide had been within reach, I
                        should perhaps have pulled him back and abandoned the enterprize
                        **** With my <span class="gap">[indecipherable]</span> resting on my shoulder, we
                        advanced among the huts in front, where I accosted a matchlock man, "The
                        night is cold"; he answered to my remark "It is very cold"*** We passed
                        unnoticed thro' a number of Sepoys and matchlock men, some of whom, were
                        escorting persons of rank in palanquins, preceded by torches. I jostled
                        against several armed men in the street, but was not spoken to. **** I was
                        in great spirits when we reached the green fields, into which I had not been
                        for five months Everything around us smelt sweet, and a carrot I took from
                        the roadside, was, the most delicious I ever tasted. I gave vent to my
                        feelings in a conversation with Kenrigee Lall, who joined in my admiration
                        of the province of Oudh, and lamented that it was now in the hands of
                        wretches, whose misgovernment and rapacity was ruining it.</div>
                    <div class="p">. By 3 o'clock in the
                        morning we arrived at a grove of mango trees, in which a man was singing at
                        the top of his voice! He was alarmed at hearing us approach, and astonished
                        us also, by calling out a guard of 25 Sepoys, all of whom asked questions.
                        Kunrigee Lall lost heart for the first time, and threw away the letter

                     decided that a thorough defeat of the mutineers in Oudh must be the first major
                     step towards re-establishing British rule. By March 1858 he had assembled
                     25,000 men for this purpose, and then began his campaign. After ten days' hard
                     fighting he finally recaptured Lucknow on 19 March, and then by a series of
                     operations in Oudh and Rohilkhand pacified&#x2014;with the usual executions and
                     reprisals&#x2014;the north of India by May. He then paused in his own personal
                     exertions from ill health; but it was because of his careful organization that
                     Sir Hugh Rose was able to muster an adequate army for the campaign in central
                     India, and because of his planning that the campaign was finally successful. In
                     India grand strategy was decided, partly on political grounds, by Lord Canning,
                     the governor-general. Influenced by his Crimean experience and wanting to
                     reduce casualties, Campbell's conduct of operations was thorough, cautious, and
                     so relatively slow. Nicknamed Old Kuberdar (&#x2018;take care&#x2019;) and Sir Crawling
                     Camel, he was criticized by some officers&#x2014;and later by Sir John Fortescue&#x2014;as
                     too cautious and slow. Concerned at British casualties from sunstroke, in 1858
                     he ordered that shakos be replaced by sun helmets. As Lord Roberts wrote,
                     &#x2018;there was a feeling throughout the army that Sir Colin was inclined to favour
                     Highlanders unduly&#x2019; (Roberts, 213). At Lucknow he ordered Colonel Ewart of the
                     93rd, &#x2018;Bring on the tartan! Let my own lads at them!&#x2019; (Hibbert, Great Mutiny,
                     340). Campbell made some mistakes: for example, his preventing Outram cutting
                     off the mutineers' retreat after their defeat at Lucknow in March 1858, and his
                     appointment of the notoriously bungling Brigadier-General R. Walpole to command
                     in Rohilkhand. Nevertheless, overall Campbell was a successful commander. The
                     mutiny further enhanced his reputation, and also enriched him by prize money.
                     On 14 May 1858 he was promoted general; on 15 January 1858 he was made colonel
                     of his favourite 93rd highlanders. In late 1858 and early 1859 there was
                     indiscipline among the East India Company's European troops over their transfer
                     to the queen's service. Campbell sympathized with their grievances and advised
                     concession and that the men &#x2018;be liberally dealt with&#x2019; (Maclagan, 243).
                     Initially he was over-ruled, then government policy changed and the crisis
                     ended. Following this &#x2018;white mutiny&#x2019; he told Canning, &#x2018;henceforth it will be
                     dangerous to the State to maintain a European local army&#x2019; (Shadwell, 2.419),
                     and he opposed the establishment of such a force. In June 1861, on the
                     foundation of the order, he was appointed a knight companion of the Order of
                     the Star of India, and on 3 July 1858 he was made Baron Clyde of Clydesdale.
                     His health was failing, and so on 4 June 1860 he left India."</span></div></div> I kept mine safe in my turban. We satisfied the

                     (1772&#x2013;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant

                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great

                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great

                        On Thursday night (Feb. 11) about 11 o'clock a very heavy thunderstorm
                            passed over us. The best description of the hailstones which fell on
                            this occasion is to say that in size and shape, though not in colour or
                            taste, they resembled very large "acidulated drops" The lightning was
                            very vivid and of a beautiful pale blue color.

                        by K.D. Reynolds for the <i>Oxford
                        Dictionary of National Biography</i>"Canning [née Stuart],
                     Charlotte Elizabeth, Countess Canning (1817&#x2013;1861), courtier and vicereine of
                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779&#x2013;1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#x2013; 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: &#x2018;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face&#x2019; (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John
                     Canning (1812&#x2013;1862), only surviving son of the prime minister, George Canning,
                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted
                     the post of governor-general of India. &#x2018;[I] will not take any part in the
                     decision but only be ready to follow like a dog&#x2019; (Surtees, 193), his wife
                     wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to
                     Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras
                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she
                     gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the
                     events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity
                     stories: &#x2018;there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been
                     &#x201c;ill-used&#x201d; anywhere&#x2019;, she wrote (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and
                     the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of
                     interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her
                     complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual
                     pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution.
                     Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in
                     Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence.
                     Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing
                     from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, &#x2018;a compliment at the expense of her
                     sex. &#x201c;Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point,
                     ah, ah&#x201d;&#x2019; (Fitzmaurice, 1.261). The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an
                     earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India
                     Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The
                     new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to
                     the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and
                     wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite
                     the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her
                     frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In
                     October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and
                     saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there.
                     She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from &#x2018;jungle fever&#x2019;,
                     or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her
                     mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18
                     November."</span></div></div> to

                        of eight centuries, it was revived again (about A.D. 792) by a descendant of

                        sceptic monarch determined to test the depth, and he caused the pillar to be
                        violently shaken. A stream of blood immediately gushed up from the earth's
                        centre, and the pillar from that time became loose or in their own language

                        Andrew Lambert for the <i>Oxford Dictionary of
                        National Biography</i>: "Watson, Rundle Burges
                     (1809&#x2013;1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson
                     (1772&#x2013;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant
                     on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and
                     on 24 December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to
                     the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years later,
                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great
                     sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam
                  era."</span></div></div> C.B, sailed for Sydney.

                        him at once among the Pundits of Hindoostan? or shall we condemn him to
                        stand forever fanning us with the Punkah? or shall we consign him to eternal

                    <div class="p">The Past Week has been extraordinarily productive of events of interest &amp;
                        amusement, and we feel bound to afford all the space we can for the same The
                        Rajah's dinner, &amp; marriage of his juvenile granddaughter, the Cricket
                        match between our Club &amp; the Squadron and our defeat; the success of our
                        Amateurs in their performance on Thursday night; all afford a supply of
                        intelligence upon the requisite space for which we are loath to encroach. A
                        few days more and we shall look back upon Calcutta and all the
                        pleasures it has afforded us, as a mem'ry of the past, &amp; fresh scenes
                        will meet us, and in turn give way to others. We shall almost regret the
                        distance, which will soon be placed between us &amp; Calcutta, for we are desirous
                        to know of the operations at Lucknow, and it is most likely we shall not hear of the
                        events which will take place in that quarter until some time after their
                        occurrence. We earnestly hope that the blow may be struck speedily, &amp;
                        let us not forget, in our regret for our absence that it is
                        certain to be "all for the best":- for our actions and movements are under
                        the wise ordinance of One who knows more than we can, and who "disposes,
                        when man proposes."</div>

                        grand dinner party fireworks and a nautch. For the information of those of
                        our readers who were unfortunately unable to go, we will attempt a slight
                        description of the events of the evening, altho' we feel that our pen will
                        fail to convey to the  an adequate impression to that which was the result of witnessing
                        it "in propria persona."</div>
                    <div class="p">We left the ship rather late (about 7 PM the dinner being announced for 7:30)
                        and on landing at Baboo's Ghant found to our dismay that no garrie was
                        waiting for us, this caused some little consternation, but a consultation
                        being held, we acted speedily upon its determination, &amp; were quickly
                        ensconced in palanqains on arriving at Wilson's Hotel, we managed to obtain
                        a garrie &amp; without further delay than we could help, set off for
                        Cossipore. Our <span class="gap">[indecipherable]</span> proved to be one of the best
                        of his kind, keeping his cattle well up to the mark.</div>
                    <div class="p">We passed through the dirty, dismal, native quarter, faintly lit by the
                        flickering glare of oil lamps, with dusky, half clad forms flitting about in
                        the misty, smoky atmosphere, which made our eyes smart and fill with tears.
                        Here and there in the deep, gloomy, shade of the interior of an old and
                        shaky building, could be seen a dark object bending over the earthenware
                        pan, in which the evening meal was cooking, whilst the flare of the lambent
                        flame as it shot up from under, would for an instant light up his dim
                        countenance &amp; the surrounding objects, and then as instantly subsiding
                        would render the obscurity more intense than ever.</div>
                    <div class="p">As we speeded along and left the suburbs of the city, emerging into more open
                        country, the notes of warning our driver had been repeatedly uttering,
                        gradually ceased, and we found ourselves passing extensive gardens, with an
                            occa<span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1122.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1122_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1122.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1122.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div>sional hut
                        here, &amp; there. At last we arrived at a place where four roads met, &amp;
                        most likely would have proceeded straight on, had not a figure which stood
                        in the road acquainted our driver that his proper course was the turning to
                        the right.</div>
                    <div class="p">Shortly after a blaze of light on our left hand told us that we were
                        approaching our goal, a few minutes more and we entered the Rajah's garden.
                        We were quite surprized at the number of lamps, and the brilliancy of the
                        illuminations, it was a transition from night to day: altho we consider that
                        the effect would have been more perfect had the lamps been variegated. On
                        our left was a large tank, surrounded by railings, on which lamps were hung,
                        close together, we are perfectly unable to judge of the probable number in
                        this spot alone, for the tank was one of the largest we have seen, &amp; the
                        lights almost touched on another: the reflection in the still water, greatly
                        enhanced the effect, especially that caused by a large building on the
                        opposite side, which was in one perfect blaze, &amp; of which we shall speak
                        more fully anon.</div>
                    <div class="p">The strains of a band met our ears as we rattled down to the garden house,
                        where upon emerging from our trap, we found the dinner was proceeding. We
                        entered and soon procured seats, which were apparently the only empty ones,
                        for we noticed some after arrivals who were unable to obtain even a corner
                        of the table. The dinner was in every respect perfect. having been placed
                        under the sole arrangement of Messrs Wilson &amp;  of Auckland Hotel, we regretted much not having arrived in time to
                        witness the appearance of the table previous to the attack, but as it was
                        (fish having been just removed) it looked remarkably well and the taste
                        displayed in the several minutiae which characterize a well laid table,
                        spoke well for the capacity of the hands to whose care the management was
                        entrusted. The room itself was gaily decorated with banners &amp; flags of
                        England, France and Turkey, and was well lighted by chandeliers, and
                        Moderator lamps. The many uniforms, of which red decidedly preponderated,
                        &amp; the glittering of the naval epaulettes, varied with the sober black of
                        the civilians, greatly enhanced the brilliancy of the table.</div>
                    <div class="p">Having appeased our appetite and slaked our thirst with first rate champagne
                        &amp; hearing sounds of native music &amp; singing in an adjoining room, we
                        quitted the table and adjourned to the apartment whence the sounds
                        proceeded. On our way thither we stopped to examine several swords &amp;
                        spears, daggers &amp; c of real Damascus steel and beautifully worked, the
                        hilts &amp; crosspieces, inlaid with gold and precious stones of all kinds.
                        We also saw a magnificent diamond in a glass case, said to be worth
                        £180.000. Of furniture we cannot speak as the rooms are all furnished in
                        Eastern style, &amp; consequently there is no display of tables, and chairs,
                        couches, settees, &amp;c, &amp;c, which we see in our commonest drawing
                        rooms in England. One small table &amp; that of marble, supported a tray
                        with betel nut and a jug of water for the benefit of the native guests,
                        &amp; carpets, spread upon a platform in a room through which we passed,
                        were appropriated to their use.</div>
                    <div class="p">On entering the room from which the nautch music had proceeded, we found that
                        we were just too late, as we caught a stern view of the musicians, as they
                        passed out of the door opposite to that we entered by. The interior
                        presented a very gay appearance, for here we saw the various garbs and
                        picturesque dresses of the native visitors, who were seated on a cushioned
                        seat which went all round the room. Some were arrayed most magnificently in shawls woven with gold, velvet embroiderd with gold, in fact
                        all the garments were heavy and thick with gold. The Rajah himself wore
                        round his neck a diamond necklace valued at £200,000 and almost all wore
                        heavy massive gold chains.</div>
                    <div class="p">The sharp whiz of a rocket announced to us that the fireworks were
                        commencing. We immediately allied forth and found ourselves in front of the
                        tank, which was reflecting on its placid surface the last falling stars of
                        the first rocket: carriages, &amp; horses, were near and around us, and as a
                        blaze of light suddenly illuminated the whole scene before us, the poor
                        frightened animals snorted &amp; started with terror, &amp; required the
                        utmost efforts of the drivers to keep them from fairly bolting away. Our
                        first care was to get out of the way of anything like a horse, and then we
                        turned to view the magnificent spectacle before us. In front &amp; around us
                        on every side, bright masses of flame, shot up in the air, dense masses of
                        smoke curled heavily upwards, thro' which flights of rockets shot with their
                        hissing roar and blue fireballs formed their graceful curves.</div>
                    <div class="p">On our right a large piece of firework was set fire to, from its original
                        appearance we supposed that it was intended to pourtray the burning of a
                        house, but as it quickly went into an entire flame, it only represented a
                        burst of flame lighting up the visages of those around us with a pale
                        unearthly glare, and by the strong but fitful illumination which it cast on
                        the projecting points of the building, throwing the recesses into gloomier
                        shadow. In various parts of the gardens, fresh gleams of light shot up &amp;
                        rockets filled the air with their fiery balls, threatening to cause some
                        damage by their falling sticks, which very often descended amongst the
                        crowd.</div>
                    <div class="p">The brilliant scene was rendered doubly impressive by the reflecting of water
                        &amp; the dense volume of smoke which hung like a canopy over the whole
                        gardens. The display which formed the finale, was erected on the opposite
                        bank of the tank, to that on which we stood and when first lighted
                        represented a square body of white fire and an arch. As the fire decreased,
                        a blue flickering flame made its appearance, and gradually increased in
                        strength until at last in the square, we read the sentence, "God save the
                        Queen, and the Young couple every Happiness," and the arch shone forth as an
                        arbour over which the blue flame played in a wavy, flickering light. This
                        was immediately hailed with three hearty cheers from the Officers &amp;
                        Englishmen present, and the company then strolled about enjoying in many
                        cases the luxury of <span class="gap">[indecipherable]</span>. We followed the example
                        and then returned to the building to witness the nautch, which was about to
                        recommence.</div>
                    <div class="p">After a short time the performers entered. They consisted of a girl, dressed
                        in a dark brown gauze dress, and scarf trimmed &amp; embroidered profusely
                        with gold, and particoloured trousers, made very full so as to hide the
                        feet. Her headdress consisted of a frontlet, hanging over the forehead with
                        side pieces and a backpiece, all of gold or imitation and studded with
                        various coloured stones. Her hands were adorned with rings &amp; from one on
                        each finger a chain communicated with a circular <span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1123.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1123_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1123.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1123.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div> plate of gold, as also from
                        the bracelets, the back of the hand being thus covered with gold. Her
                        personal appearance was not in the least attractive in fact she looked most
                        remarkably like a monkey dressed up Four musicians accompanied her in her
                        song, which was perfectly unintelligible, altho' good taste was exhibited in
                        the instrumental sound being commanded by the vocal of the musicians two
                        played upon a species of violin supported in a linen band which went round
                        the waist, the bow being handled in much the same manner as a bass viol
                        player would hold it Another had two little brass cymbals about the size of
                        the palm of the hand, which he manipulated with extreme dexterity, and under
                        his able guidance they emitted a pleasant jingling sound. The fourth played
                        on two small drums of curious shape &amp; make suspended round his waist in
                        a linen cloth, and which were played by the action of the fingers &amp;
                        palms of the hand. The costumes of the men were nothing out of the common
                        native dress excepting the nether garments of the "drummer" as we call him,
                        and we heard them very much admired, not only for their pattern, "a pink
                        check":-but for the cut &amp; fit, which would have gained the envy and
                        admiration of all Regent Street, had they been there displayed.</div>
                    <div class="p">The dancing consisted of an advancing &amp; retrograde movement, accompanied
                        with a waving motion of the hands the arms being held in would-be graceful
                        positions over the head, &amp; the feet being occasionally brought together
                        so as to make the anclets strike &amp; jingle. Altogether nothing absurd and
                        vapid ever met our gaze, novelty was its only charm, and we left the room to
                        visit the marriage presents &amp; the celebration of the marriage
                        ceremony.</div>
                    <div class="p">We bent our steps towards the building we have mentioned as attracting our
                        attention from its blaze of light, when we entered. Here we found all the
                        presents arranged for exhibition, amongst which we noticed cup, and trays of
                        solid silver, two handsome enamelled serpent-bracelets studded with diamonds
                        and amethysts, with large rubies in the heads, a necklace of pearls, with
                        emeralds at equidistances: several handsome cachmere shawls, gold rings,
                        linen pieces silver worked vases, and a bedstead of solid sliver, with rose
                        coloured mosquito curtains and a coverlet of Persian workmanship. Wreaths of
                        white flowers were heaped up in a silver bowl, and on a large plate of the
                        same metal small bouquets of flowers were arranged.</div>
                    <div class="p">Close by under a canopy supported by poles of solid silver, sat the
                        bridegroom robed in a splendid shawl, and surrounded by priests in front of
                        him, sat a nautch girl, with her attendant musicians, keeping up a
                        neverending song in Persian and now, we were informed that the ceremony
                        would commence shortly, so we determined to wait and not miss it. Smoking
                        was not considered offensive, so we whiled away the time, scanning &amp;
                        enquiring into the various novelties surrounding us, which excited our
                        curiosity, and which would require the space of a volume to enumerate. The
                        bridegroom appeared to be about 15 years of age and if we might judge by his
                        countenance did not seem to entertain a high notion of the felicity of his
                        situation.</div>
                    <div class="p">We had not long to wait before a change took place. The Bridegroom rose from
                        his luxurious seat and the priests arrayed him in snow white linen garments;
                        he now took his station upon a square piece of sandalwood, painted and
                        ornamented in a pretty device, and squatted down in Hindoo fashion upon his
                        haunches: a very strange looking white turban was not placed on his head and
                        in front of this was fastened a high frontlet, made of worked silver wire
                        (and presenting in a front  view, the appearance of a parish
                        beadle's cocked hat), with two enormous tassels depending from each end.</div>
                    <div class="p">He sat, or rather squatted in this position for about half an hour, when the
                        priests again disrobed him and redressed him in red silk leaving the right
                        shoulder &amp; arm bare, again he squatted down, &amp; the large fronlet was
                        removed, &amp; a smaller but similar headdress took its place &amp; the two
                        bracelets I have mentioned before were clasped on his wrists. He now bared
                        his right knee, and his father who was seated on his right hand between two
                        priests, extended his right hand &amp; placed the two forefingers &amp;
                        thumb on his son's knee; at first we were under the impression that he was
                        testing him by introducing some pointed instrument, but as he remained in
                        this position for about ten minutes, we were unable to determine what the
                        intention was. The presents were then shown to him the shawls, rings &amp;c
                        being passed round so his father who held them before him.</div>
                    <div class="p">Shortly after this ceremony the priests, bridegroom &amp; his father rose,
                        and being once more enveloped in the ample folds of the cachmere shawl, he
                        was led away with torchbearers in front, to visit, (as we were informed) the
                        family, &amp; to be introduced for the first time to the bride. During his
                        absence we were decorated with bouquets &amp; wreaths of a sweet smelling
                        white flower, &amp; presented a very gay appearance with our caps and
                        breasts thus adorned.</div>
                    <div class="p">About 20 min. elapsed when the bridegroom reappeared and took his station as
                        before on the square of sandalwood, a similar one was placed opposite to him
                        the bride appeared and squatted down upon it; a voice in the crowd
                        immediately called for "Three Cheers for the Bride" which were heartily
                        given. Poor little thing!!! She had arrived at the mature age of 9 and was
                        already to become a wife. She was dressed in red silk similar to her
                        husband, and a ring through her nose. Think of this! Oh! ye' fair brides of
                        England, but let me inform you that this is a religious custom, &amp; was
                        not placed there for her future husband to make use of to "lead her by the
                        nose".</div>
                    <div class="p">The fingers of her right hand were now entwined with his, and a wreath of
                        flowers bound round them, the holy water of the Ganges was next poured over
                        the joined hands. A gold ring was then placed in the father's hand, who held
                        it in the vessel containing the holy water, and repeated a long
                        unintelligible rigmarole after the priest, after which it was placed on the
                        two joined hands of the young couple &amp; holy water sprinkled over it,
                        Incense was then burnt, the hands separated and the ceremony completed. </div>
                    <div class="p">The happy (?) pair were led off by torchlight. For ourselves, we made it our
                        study to find our garrie and having succeeded after some little trouble, we
                        were speedily borne from this novel and interesting scene, and returned on
                        board heartily pleased with our excursion. </div>

                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779&#x2013;1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#x2013; 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: &#x2018;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face&#x2019; (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John

                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted

                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she
                     gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the
                     events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity
                     stories: &#x2018;there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been
                     &#x201c;ill-used&#x201d; anywhere&#x2019;, she wrote (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and
                     the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of
                     interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her
                     complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual
                     pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution.
                     Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in
                     Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence.
                     Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing
                     from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, &#x2018;a compliment at the expense of her
                     sex. &#x201c;Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point,
                     ah, ah&#x201d;&#x2019; (Fitzmaurice, 1.261). The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an
                     earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India
                     Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The
                     new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to
                     the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and
                     wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite
                     the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her
                     frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In
                     October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and
                     saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there.
                     She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from &#x2018;jungle fever&#x2019;,
                     or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her
                     mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18
                     November."</span></div></div>. The Hon. Mrs Stuart, the Hon  Stanley, &amp; Attendants.

                        Dictionary of National Biography</i>"Canning [née Stuart],
                     Charlotte Elizabeth, Countess Canning (1817&#x2013;1861), courtier and vicereine of
                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779&#x2013;1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#x2013; 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: &#x2018;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face&#x2019; (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John
                     Canning (1812&#x2013;1862), only surviving son of the prime minister, George Canning,
                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted
                     the post of governor-general of India. &#x2018;[I] will not take any part in the
                     decision but only be ready to follow like a dog&#x2019; (Surtees, 193), his wife
                     wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to
                     Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras
                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she

                        Bluejackets in their several Divisions:-like men, I say for however we may
                        admire the mechanical march of drilled soldiers, I hope Bluejackets will
                        always have the free use of their arms and legs.</div>
                    <div class="p">When we arrived on the field of action, our Artillery Companies separated and
                        marched to Fort William to bring out their Field pieces, while we remained
                        exercising in the field: it would weary your readers, Mr. Editor to describe
                        the whole course of our proceedings, how we prepared to resist cavalry,
                        formed into square &amp;c-&amp;c:- suffice it to say that great satisfaction
                        was caused to ourselves, and great wonderment to the native niggers, and we
                        only wished that a few hundred Sepoys were there to practice upon in real
                        earnest. As for the Marine Light Infantry they went right away all over the
                            field and I did not wonder at their having a jolly good run -
                        skirmishing they called it - after being so long penned up on board
                        ship.</div>
                    <div class="p">The "bang, bang", of our field pieces, now drew the attention of all
                            Calcutta upon us,
                        and the fashionable ladies and gentlemen who were out riding, came flocking
                        round us to see so novel a spectacle. The artillery did as beautifully as
                        all the rest of us, and even the small guns worked by small boys, made a
                        very considerable noise on this eventful occasion. But everything must have
                        an end, Mr Editor, so had our field practice, &amp; so also must my letter.
                        See us again drawn up in the line of march, again the lively strains of the
                        "Cheasapeake's" band float over the Calcutta Esplanade, &amp;
                        crowds of Hindoo niggers flock round to see the Regiment of British Tars

                    <div class="p">There is nothing spoken, done, written or effected in this world, but the
                        ever ready <span class="pagebreak"><span class="thumbnail"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1134.jpg"><img src="pages/thumbs/TYI1134_thumb.jpg"></img></a></span><span class="viewsize"><a href="pages/viewsize/TYI1134.jpg">View Page</a></span><br></br><span class="fullsize"><a href="pages/fullsize/TYI1134.jpg" target="_blank">Full size in new window</a></span></span><div class="formework"></div>tongue of criticism is prepared to weaken or
                        destroy its effect. We certainly expected that our Amateurs would not come
                        off scatheless, but we were totally unprepared for such an egregious attack
                        as has been made upon them in the Bengal Hurkaru. It was with mingled
                        feelings of astonishment, anger, and amusement we perused the inconsiderate
                        critique upon their endeavours. The whole when carefully weighed forms a
                        "tout ensemble" of the most ridiculous character, and we therefore advise
                        all those who read it to take it in that light, basing their opinions, not
                        merely upon a sentence extracted here and there but upon the general
                        sentiment it contains. It opens with a personal cut at Mr. Van Gelder,
                        thereby evincing that a wish to bring him before the public as a laughing
                        stock, was a prominent feature in the desire to ridicule, which animated the
                        narrow mind, which presumed to judge of our Amateurs performance. The writer
                        then proceeds to state that "he trembled for the fate of those of Neptune's
                        Hardy Sons"&#x2014;for why? because "the beauty and fashion of Calcutta were present," most
                        likely he imagined the "hardy sons of Neptune" could never stand a battery
                        of bright eyes, however brave when confronting a battery of heavy guns. But
                        we cannot afford space to pull him to pieces in the manner he deserves, but
                        we must notice one thing. The word "Ditchers." such is the very euphonious
                        appellation which the Histrionic Critic of the Hurkaru claims for himself
                        and his copeers of Calcutta. We will not now enquire into the origin of the
                        name, but simply observe that such being the title of our assailant, we need
                        not feel surprised to find him such an adept in the art of "flinging mud."

                        by K.D. Reynolds for the <i>Oxford
                        Dictionary of National Biography</i>"Canning [née Stuart],
                     Charlotte Elizabeth, Countess Canning (1817&#x2013;1861), courtier and vicereine of
                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779&#x2013;1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#x2013; 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: &#x2018;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face&#x2019; (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John
                     Canning (1812&#x2013;1862), only surviving son of the prime minister, George Canning,
                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted
                     the post of governor-general of India. &#x2018;[I] will not take any part in the
                     decision but only be ready to follow like a dog&#x2019; (Surtees, 193), his wife
                     wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to
                     Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras
                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she
                     gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the
                     events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity
                     stories: &#x2018;there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been
                     &#x201c;ill-used&#x201d; anywhere&#x2019;, she wrote (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and
                     the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of
                     interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her
                     complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual
                     pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution.
                     Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in
                     Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence.
                     Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing
                     from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, &#x2018;a compliment at the expense of her
                     sex. &#x201c;Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point,
                     ah, ah&#x201d;&#x2019; (Fitzmaurice, 1.261). The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an
                     earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India
                     Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The
                     new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to
                     the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and
                     wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite
                     the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her
                     frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In
                     October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and
                     saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there.
                     She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from &#x2018;jungle fever&#x2019;,
                     or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her
                     mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18
                     November."</span></div></div>, the Honble Mr rs Stuart and attendants.

                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779&#x2013;1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789&#x2013; 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: &#x2018;She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face&#x2019; (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John
                     Canning (1812&#x2013;1862), only surviving son of the prime minister, George Canning,
                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted
                     the post of governor-general of India. &#x2018;[I] will not take any part in the
                     decision but only be ready to follow like a dog&#x2019; (Surtees, 193), his wife
                     wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to
                     Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras
                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she
                     gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the
                     events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity
                     stories: &#x2018;there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been
                     &#x201c;ill-used&#x201d; anywhere&#x2019;, she wrote (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and
                     the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of
                     interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her
                     complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual
                     pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution.
                     Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in
                     Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence.
                     Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing
                     from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, &#x2018;a compliment at the expense of her
                     sex. &#x201c;Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point,
                     ah, ah&#x201d;&#x2019; (Fitzmaurice, 1.261). The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an
                     earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India
                     Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The
                     new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to
                     the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and
                     wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite
                     the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her
                     frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In
                     October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and
                     saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there.
                     She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from &#x2018;jungle fever&#x2019;,
                     or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her
                     mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18
                     November."</span></div></div> &amp;

                     (1809&#x2013;1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson
                     (1772&#x2013;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant
                     on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and
                     on 24 December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to
                     the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years later,
                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great
                     sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam
                  era."</span></div></div> received despatches

                     received his early education at Eton College, and entered the navy in January
                     1834. [...] In May 1855 [Seymour] was appointed to the floating battery Meteor,
                     which he took out to the Crimea, and brought back to Portsmouth in the early
                     summer of 1856. In July 1857 he commissioned the Pelorus, which he commanded
                     for nearly six years on the Australian station. Between January and April 1858
                     the Pelorus provided a naval brigade in Burma, playing a vital role in
                     preventing the spread of the mutiny from India. From 1860 to 1861 he commanded
                     the naval brigade in New Zealand during the war there, for which he was made a
                     CB on 16 July 1861."</span></div></div>.

                        Andrew Lambert for the <i>Oxford Dictionary of
                        National Biography</i>: "Watson, Rundle Burges
                     (1809&#x2013;1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson
                     (1772&#x2013;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant
                     on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and
                     on 24 December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to
                     the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years later,
                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great
                     sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam
                  era."</span></div></div>,
