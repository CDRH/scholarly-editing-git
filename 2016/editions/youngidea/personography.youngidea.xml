               <note>Reverend John William Lewis Bampfield joined the Chesapeake on July 24th 1857
                  and was a regular contributor to and supporter of The Young Idea. While his age is
                  not recorded in the muster book, census records reveal that Bampfield was born in
                  June of 1823, so he was in his mid-thirties during the cruise. He was commissioned
                  as chaplain aboard a different royal naval vessel in Port Royal, Jamaica before
                  his arrival aboard the Chesapeake. His detailed journal provides an additional
                  witness to The Young Idea, providing fascinating points of contrast from the
                  facsimile edition that McArthur had printed in 1867 and offering hints about the
                  authorship of contributions through his inclusion of the initials of authors (a

               <note>Harry Edmund Edgell joined the Chesapeake as Commodore after the period
                  chronicled in the issues included in this edition. He was an enthusiastic
                  supporter of The Young Idea. In <hi rend="italics">Martello Tower" in China, and
                     the Pacific in H.M.S. "Tribune," 1856-60</hi>, Francis Martin Norman recounts
                  Edgell's enthusiastic support for a shipboard theatrical aboard H.M.S. Tribune in
                  1857, when he was captain of the ship. Edgell composed the prologue for the play
                  and painted the drop-scene (50). The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich (NMM)
                  holds over 300 watercolors by Edgell, including some undertaken during the cruise
                  chronicled in The Young Idea. The NMM's biographical note on Edgell reads as
                  follows: "Edgell was promoted to lieutenant in 1828, to commander in 1837 and to
                  captain in 1846. He was appointed to command the Tribune in 1855 when she was in
                  the Crimea. During this commission she went to the Pacific and finally to China.
                  In 1857 Edgell was the Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong and he transferred into
                  the Bittern tender commanding the gun boats on the Canton River during the
                  hostilities with the Chinese. In 1858 be was given command of the squadron in
                  Indian waters, during which time he commanded the Chesapeake and later the
                  Retribution. The latter returned to England and was paid off in 1860. Edgell had
                  no further active employment and was promoted on the retired list, reaching the
                  rank of vice-admiral in 1871."</note>

                     (1809–1860), naval officer, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson
                     (1772–1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant
                     on 7 October 1829. [...] On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and
                     on 24 December was made a CB. [...] In December 1852 [Watson] was appointed to
                     the new steam frigate Impérieuse (50 guns), then, and for some years later,
                     considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the
                     Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of
                     small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no
                     Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The
                     Impérieuse continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the
                     campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As
                     the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service,
                     Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and
                     leadership. After the peace the Impérieuse was sent to the North American
                     station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856
                     until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was
                     appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July
                     1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great
                     sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam
                  era."</quote></note>

                     <quote>"Campbell [formerly Macliver], Colin, Baron Clyde (1792–1863), army
                     officer, born Macliver, the eldest son of John Macliver (d. 22 December 1858,
                     aged ninety-two), a carpenter in Glasgow—whose father's Ardnave estate was
                     forfeited following the Jacobite rising of 1745—and his wife,
                     Agnes, née Campbell, of the Campbells of Islay, was born at John Street,
                     Glasgow, on 20 October 1792. His mother died when he was a boy, and her
                     brother, Colonel John Campbell, paid for Colin's education. He attended Glasgow
                     grammar school and Gosport military academy. In 1807 Colonel Campbell took him
                     to the duke of York as candidate for a commission. The duke assumed he was
                     ‘another of the clan’ and his name was entered as Campbell, which he
                     thenceforth used. […] In March 1857 Campbell was offered command of the
                     expedition then forming for China, which he refused. On 11 July arrived the
                     news of the outbreak of the Indian mutiny and the death of General Anson, the
                     commander-in-chief in India. That day Lord Panmure offered Campbell the
                     command-in-chief. He accepted, and started next day for India. He arrived at
                     Calcutta in August, and heard at once the news of the recovery of Delhi by
                     Major-General Archdale Wilson, and of Havelock's capture of Cawnpore, and his
                     preparations for the first relief of Lucknow. Campbell hurried to Cawnpore the
                     troops intended for the China expedition, which Lord Elgin had wisely sent to
                     Calcutta, and assembled there also picked troops from the army which had taken
                     Delhi. After two months of hard work organizing the troops and clearing Lower
                     Bengal, he took command of the army at the Alambagh, and, leaving General C. A.
                     Windham to hold Cawnpore, started on 9 November with 4700 men and 32 guns to
                     save the British (under Outram and Havelock) at Lucknow. His force, largely
                     European troops—and including the 93rd and Captain William Peel's naval
                     brigade—reached Lucknow, stormed the sikandarabagh (16 November), then broke
                     through to Outram and Havelock in the residency. Campbell evacuated the Lucknow
                     garrison and its many dependants (11–23 November), leaving a force under Outram
                     holding the Alambagh, 3 miles south of Lucknow. On 30 November Campbell reached
                     Cawnpore and sent the rescued on steamers to Calcutta. Meanwhile his success
                     had been endangered by Tantia Topi's defeat of Windham in front of Cawnpore
                     (26–8 November), but he arrived in time to prevent further disaster; on 6
                     December he attacked and decisively defeated Tantia Topi, and established his
                     headquarters there. The winter months abounded in minor operations. Campbell
                     decided that a thorough defeat of the mutineers in Oudh must be the first major
                     step towards re-establishing British rule. By March 1858 he had assembled
                     25,000 men for this purpose, and then began his campaign. After ten days' hard
                     fighting he finally recaptured Lucknow on 19 March, and then by a series of
                     operations in Oudh and Rohilkhand pacified—with the usual executions and
                     reprisals—the north of India by May. He then paused in his own personal
                     exertions from ill health; but it was because of his careful organization that
                     Sir Hugh Rose was able to muster an adequate army for the campaign in central
                     India, and because of his planning that the campaign was finally successful. In
                     India grand strategy was decided, partly on political grounds, by Lord Canning,
                     the governor-general. Influenced by his Crimean experience and wanting to
                     reduce casualties, Campbell's conduct of operations was thorough, cautious, and
                     so relatively slow. Nicknamed Old Kuberdar (‘take care’) and Sir Crawling
                     Camel, he was criticized by some officers—and later by Sir John Fortescue—as
                     too cautious and slow. Concerned at British casualties from sunstroke, in 1858
                     he ordered that shakos be replaced by sun helmets. As Lord Roberts wrote,
                     ‘there was a feeling throughout the army that Sir Colin was inclined to favour
                     Highlanders unduly’ (Roberts, 213). At Lucknow he ordered Colonel Ewart of the
                     93rd, ‘Bring on the tartan! Let my own lads at them!’ (Hibbert, Great Mutiny,
                     340). Campbell made some mistakes: for example, his preventing Outram cutting
                     off the mutineers' retreat after their defeat at Lucknow in March 1858, and his
                     appointment of the notoriously bungling Brigadier-General R. Walpole to command
                     in Rohilkhand. Nevertheless, overall Campbell was a successful commander. The
                     mutiny further enhanced his reputation, and also enriched him by prize money.
                     On 14 May 1858 he was promoted general; on 15 January 1858 he was made colonel
                     of his favourite 93rd highlanders. In late 1858 and early 1859 there was
                     indiscipline among the East India Company's European troops over their transfer
                     to the queen's service. Campbell sympathized with their grievances and advised
                     concession and that the men ‘be liberally dealt with’ (Maclagan, 243).
                     Initially he was over-ruled, then government policy changed and the crisis
                     ended. Following this ‘white mutiny’ he told Canning, ‘henceforth it will be
                     dangerous to the State to maintain a European local army’ (Shadwell, 2.419),
                     and he opposed the establishment of such a force. In June 1861, on the
                     foundation of the order, he was appointed a knight companion of the Order of
                     the Star of India, and on 3 July 1858 he was made Baron Clyde of Clydesdale.
                     His health was failing, and so on 4 June 1860 he left India."</quote></note>

                     <quote>“Havelock, Sir Henry (1795–1857), army officer, was born on Easter day,
                     5 April 1795, at Ford Hall, Bishopwearmouth, near Sunderland, second son of
                     William Havelock (1757–1837), shipbuilder and shipowner, and Jane, daughter of
                     John Carter, solicitor, of Stockton-on-Tees. […] Henry was thrown on his own
                     resources in 1814, having quarrelled with his father, but with his brother
                     William's help, and against his father's wishes, he joined the army. William
                     had already done so and had distinguished himself at Waterloo. Havelock joined
                     the 95th foot (Rifle brigade) and was commissioned second lieutenant on 30 July
                     1815, spending the next eight years at home on garrison duties. He was
                     fortunate to serve under Captain (later Major-General Sir) Harry Smith, a truly
                     professional soldier, who encouraged Havelock to study his profession. He
                     decided to try his fortunes in India (where his brothers William and Charles
                     Frederick were already serving), but not before he had made intensive studies
                     in Hindustani and Persian at the Oriental Institute; he then exchanged into the
                     13th foot (Somerset light infantry) which was under orders for India. He was
                     now a lieutenant but dependent solely on his pay in an army ruled by purchase
                     of promotion. He sailed for India on 3 January 1823 […] On 20 June 1854
                     Havelock obtained his regimental lieutenant-colonelcy and brevet colonelcy. He
                     had left his family in Bonn when he returned to India at the end of 1851. War
                     with Persia was declared on 1 November 1856, and early in 1857 Havelock was
                     given a brigade in a force commanded by Brigadier-General Sir James Outram, an
                     officer of the East India Company. Havelock drew up the plan for the successful
                     attack on Muhammarah, but the war petered out when a peace treaty was signed in
                     Paris on 4 March 1857. Havelock then returned to India, arriving back in Bombay
                     on 20 May to find that the Bengal native army had broken out into mutiny.
                     Travel overland being unsafe, he took the first available ship for Calcutta but
                     was wrecked off Ceylon. He eventually reached Calcutta via Madras on 17 June.
                     He was at once given command of a column to be sent up-country to relieve
                     Cawnpore where the garrison was besieged in makeshift entrenchments. Thereafter
                     he was to support Sir Henry Lawrence who was under siege in the residency
                     compound in Lucknow. Havelock's appointment was not universally approved in
                     Calcutta, but as Lady Canning, wife of the governor-general, was to comment:
                     General Havelock is not in fashion, but all the same we believe he will do
                     well. No doubt he is fussy and tiresome, but his little, old, stiff figure
                     looks as active and fit for use as if he were made of steel. (Pollock, 153)
                     Havelock's force consisted of the 64th foot (North Staffords), four companies
                     of the 78th highlanders (Seaforths), two companies of the 84th (York and
                     Lancaster) regiment, and a detachment of the 1st Madras European fusiliers (an
                     East India Company regiment), the balance of which was in Allahabad under
                     Lieutenant-Colonel J. G. Neill. There was a scratch collection of gunners to
                     serve the six guns, twenty assorted officers and civilians to form the few
                     cavalry, and some native irregulars. In total the force amounted to fewer than
                     2000 all ranks. […] The relief column entered Cawnpore on 17 July, too late to
                     save the hard-pressed garrison or the women and children who had been butchered
                     on the orders of the treacherous Nana Sahib. Lucknow must be the next
                     objective, and on 25 July they crossed the flooded Ganges and set foot in Oudh.
                     […] The relieving force had to fight hard to reach the residency, which it did
                     before it grew dark on 25 September. Outram had been wounded, though not
                     seriously, and Neill was killed. Harry Havelock distinguished himself, but his
                     left arm was broken. He was lucky to escape when the sepoys set about killing
                     the convoy of wounded. He was to return later. Outram was put to bed in the
                     residency, assuming the command the next day, and Havelock was taken to dinner
                     by Mrs Inglis, wife of Colonel John Inglis who had commanded the beleaguered
                     garrison after the death of Sir Henry Lawrence. Havelock had believed the
                     garrison was running short of supplies and was surprised to sit down to a
                     dinner of beef cutlets, with mock turtle soup and champagne. Lucknow had been
                     relieved at a cost of 535 men killed and wounded. Carts for the evacuation of
                     women, children, and wounded were impossible to obtain. It was clear that a
                     retreat to Cawnpore would be a difficult, if not impossible, operation. Outram,
                     with Havelock's agreement, decided to remain in the residency and reinforce its
                     garrison. They knew that the newly arrived commander-in-chief, Sir Colin
                     Campbell, was gathering together a substantial force for Lucknow's relief. It
                     was a wise decision. Campbell finally arrived on 16 November after hard
                     fighting. Outram and Havelock went to meet him and were greeted as ‘Sir James’
                     and ‘Sir Henry’, the first time Havelock learned that he had been made a KCB.
                     There was also a letter from the duke of Cambridge telling Havelock he had been
                     promoted major-general. This was wonderful news, but Havelock was daily growing
                     weaker as a result of dysentery, added to the effects of six months'
                     campaigning in a difficult climate. Nursed by Harry, one arm in a sling, and
                     his faithful aide-de-camp Hargood, Havelock was quietly slipping away. At 9.30
                     a.m. on Monday, 24 November 1857, he finally did so, in the arms of his son, to
                     whom his last words supposedly were, ‘Harry, see how a Christian can die’
                     (Pollock, 252). Campbell had already decided to evacuate the residency, leaving
                     a substantial force under Outram at the Alambagh as a base for a future attack.
                     By the day of Havelock's death the evacuation was virtually complete. They
                     buried him in the garden of the Alambagh, under a mango tree on which Harry
                     carved the letter ‘H’, and took careful measurements of the grave before
                     smoothing it down. It is there to this day.”</quote></note>

                     officer, third and favourite son of Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788–1850)
                     [and] prime minister. [...] On 13 September 1856 [Peel] commissioned the
                     Shannon, a powerful 50-gun steamfrigate, for service in China. She did not sail
                     until the following March. At Singapore she was met by the news of the Indian
                     mutiny, and took Lord Elgin up to Hong Kong, arriving on 2 July. Admiral Sir
                     Michael Seymour sent the Shannon back to Calcutta on July 16, with Elgin on
                     board, together with a detachment of marines and soldiers. At Calcutta, Peel
                     formed a naval brigade. On 14 August he left the ship with 450 men, six
                     24-pounder Bengal artillery guns, and two 8 inch howitzers. At Allahabad on 20
                     October he was reinforced by a party of 120 men, and from then on was present
                     in all the principal operations. The coolness of his bravery was everywhere
                     remarkable, and his formidable battery gave most efficient service: the huge
                     guns were, under his orders, moved and worked as though they were light field
                     pieces. On 21 January 1858 he was nominated a KCB and an aidede-camp to the
                     queen. In 1858 Peel's brigade employed six naval 8 inch guns from the Shannon.
                     Peel mounted these massive weapons, weighing 65 cwt each, on carriages locally
                     constructed by the sailors. They provided the firepower to overcome the massive
                     walls of Indian forts, and to keep down British casualties. In the second
                     relief of Lucknow on 9 March 1858 Peel was severely wounded in the thigh by a
                     musket bullet, which was cut out from the opposite side of the leg. Still very
                     weak, he reached Cawnpore on his way to England, and there, on 20 April, he
                     contracted smallpox, of which he died on 27 April, aged
                  thirty-three."</quote></note>

                     Outram (bap. 1764, d. 1805), civil engineer and ironmaster, of Butterley Hall,
                     Derbyshire, and his wife, Margaret (1778–1863), daughter of Dr James Anderson
                     of Mounie, Aberdeenshire, was born at Butterley Hall on 29 January 1803. […]
                     From 1814 Outram was educated in Aberdeen first at Udny School, then at Mr
                     Esson's school, and finally (in 1818) at Marischal College. In 1819 he received
                     a direct Indian cadetship, sailed for India in May, and arrived in Bombay on 15
                     August. He was temporarily posted to the 4th native infantry, with rank as
                     ensign from 2 May 1819, and then was gazetted a lieutenant in the 1st grenadier
                     native infantry, but was shortly afterwards transferred to the 12th regiment
                     and became acting-adjutant in July 1820. […] For the next fourteen years Outram
                     was engaged in a little-known, but vital, aspect of the establishment of
                     British rule in western India: the subjugation of petty chieftains and tribal
                     peoples in the region known as Khandesh and in the interior of Gujarat. The
                     official reports speak of ‘tribal rebellions’, ‘outrages’ against the British,
                     the lawlessness of marauding bands of tribal peoples, and the refusal of some
                     of the chiefs to accept the new British order. While the contests were unequal,
                     pitting poorly armed and undisciplined groups against the armies of the East
                     India Company, the petty chiefs and the tribal leaders fought tenaciously. […]
                     In July 1853, having been promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel in the
                     preceding month, Outram returned to India, arriving at Calcutta on 12
                     September. While at Calcutta, at the request of the governor-general, he wrote
                     ‘Memorandum on the invasion of India from the westward’, which argued that the
                     Indus River should be the western frontier of British India. The court of
                     directors had written to the governor-general to find employment for Outram
                     under the supreme government, and the transfer, towards the end of the year, of
                     Baroda from the Bombay government to the government of India enabled Lord
                     Dalhousie to reinstate Outram as resident there. Outram arrived at Baroda on 19
                     March 1854, and, after holding the office for a month, was appointed political
                     agent and commanded at Aden. He embarked at Bombay in June, but the change to
                     Aden in the hot season affected his health. In November Lord Dalhousie
                     appointed him to the residency of Oudh, and he made his official entry into
                     Lucknow on 5 December. Outram was instructed to prepare at once a report on the
                     condition of the country, and to state whether the improvement demanded by Lord
                     Hardinge seven years previously had in any degree been effected. In March 1855
                     he submitted his report, which represented the condition of Oudh as deplorable,
                     and reluctantly recommended annexation as the only remedy. Annexation took
                     place in February 1856, but with harsher terms for the ruler than Outram had
                     recommended. Outram was promoted major-general on 28 November 1854, and was
                     made KCB in February 1856. Ill health compelled him to return home in May. The
                     Anglo-Persian War, 1857 On 13 November Outram was summoned to India House and
                     informed that he had been appointed to the command of the army for the
                     Anglo-Persian War. Outram was given the local rank of lieutenant-general, and
                     invested with diplomatic powers. He left England at once, and landed at Bombay
                     on 22 December 1856. He left Bombay on 15 January 1857, and arrived at Bushehr
                     on 27 January. The Persian commander-in-chief was at Borazjan, and was
                     collecting a large force there. Outram determined to attack this position and,
                     after a march of 46 miles in forty-one hours, in cold, wet, and stormy weather,
                     the camp was reached, and found to have been hastily abandoned on Outram's
                     approach. Outram commenced his return march on the night of 7 February to
                     Bushehr, carrying with him large stores of provision. On the march, at daybreak
                     on 8 February, they were attacked at Khushab by some 6000 Persians, with a few
                     guns. After a smart action, in which 700 Persians were killed and two guns
                     captured, the Persian force fled. It was not until 26 March that operations
                     were commenced against the Persian stronghold, Muhammarah. The Persians
                     abandoned their position and fled, leaving sixteen guns and all their baggage
                     stores and ammunition behind them. Peace had already been concluded at Baghdad,
                     and the war was at an end. Outram was sent to Baghdad in May to arrange the
                     formation of a mission to see that the evacuation of Herat fortress and
                     district was duly carried out by the Persians. He returned to Bombay on 26 June
                     1857. For his services Outram was made GCB. The Indian mutiny, 1857–1858
                     Meanwhile the Indian mutiny had broken out, and Outram's son, who was stationed
                     at Aligarh, and his wife had a narrow escape. Outram reached Calcutta on 31
                     July, and on 8 August was given command of two divisions of the Bengal army
                     occupying the country from Calcutta to Cawnpore inclusive, while he was also
                     made chief commissioner of Oudh in succession to Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence,
                     killed in the defence of Lucknow. He took with him Robert Napier as his
                     military secretary and chief of staff, and arrived at Dinapore on 19 August. On
                     1 September he was at Allahabad, and on 15 September he reached Cawnpore.
                     Outram had already telegraphed from Benares to Havelock that he would shortly
                     join him at Cawnpore with reinforcements, but that he would leave to Havelock
                     the glory of the relief of Lucknow, accompanying him only in his civil capacity
                     as commissioner, and placing his military services at Havelock's disposal as a
                     volunteer. On 28 September Sir Colin Campbell confirmed Outram's temporary
                     transfer of command by a general order, in which he called attention to the
                     disinterested sacrifice made by Outram in favour of Havelock. On 19 September
                     1857 the force crossed the river and marched out of Cawnpore. On 23 September,
                     in the action of the Alambagh, Outram, at the head of the volunteer and native
                     cavalry, pursued the flying enemy to the Charbagh Bridge. On 25 September
                     Havelock's force, after severe fighting, in which Outram received a flesh wound
                     in the arm, won their way to the residency. Outram resumed his military command
                     by a general order on 26 September. He found that he had simply reinforced a
                     beleaguered garrison, and was himself effectually besieged until November, when
                     Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief, came to the rescue. On 12 November
                     Outram, on his side, blew in the outer wall of the garden of the palace of
                     Farid Bakhsh, and opened his batteries on the insurgent defences in front. The
                     buildings were soon in his possession; but he was still half a mile from the
                     most advanced post of Sir Colin Campbell's force, and the way was under the
                     enemy's fire. Outram, however, determined to meet Sir Colin Campbell without
                     delay and, with Havelock and seven others, set out. Four were struck down, but
                     Outram, Havelock, and their surviving companions reached the Moti Mahal unhurt.
                     After a short conference they made their way back. Sir Colin entrusted the
                     withdrawal of the garrison and the evacuation of the residency to Outram. After
                     the evacuation of the residency Campbell left Outram with a field force at the
                     Alambagh position to hold the city of Lucknow until Campbell had placed his
                     convoy in safety and disposed of the Gwalior mutineers. For three months
                     Outram's division, consisting of about 5000 men and 25 guns, kept in check
                     120,000 organized troops with more than 130 guns. The leader of the rebels at
                     Lucknow was the famous Maulvi known as Ahmad Shah. He made determined efforts
                     to sever Outram's communications, and continually harassed his outposts. From
                     the end of December 1857 and through January and February 1858 sharp
                     engagements were fought, in which Outram's troops were successful. The last and
                     most desperate attack was made by the rebels on 25 February, and it was not
                     until dawn the next day that they were completely routed and fell back on
                     Lucknow. On 1 March 1858 Campbell returned to take Lucknow. Outram was placed
                     in command of a large force of picked troops on the north side of the Gumti
                     River, and, crossing the river on 6 March, he pitched his camp near the Fyzabad
                     Road. On 9 March he made his attack, seizing the Chakar Kothi, or yellow house,
                     the key of the enemy's position in that quarter, and, driving the rebels to the
                     river, threw up batteries on its bank to keep down the enemy's fire.
                     The kaisarbagh fell to Sir Colin Campbell on the morning of 14 March. On 16
                     March Outram, having recrossed the Gumti, advanced through the Chattar Manzil
                     and carried the residency. On the morning of 19 March Outram attacked the
                     Musabagh, held by 5000 men and thirteen guns, and carried it, capturing twelve
                     guns. So ended the capture of Lucknow. Last years, 1858–1860 Outram was
                     appointed military member of the governor-general's council, and, handing over
                     the charge of Oudh to Robert Montgomery, left Lucknow on 4 April and joined
                     Lord Canning at Allahabad. Many important matters, such as the reorganization
                     of the Indian army, were under consideration during Outram's tenure of office,
                     and he left many wise and carefully prepared minutes recording his views. A
                     baronetcy was conferred upon him by the queen, and the House of Commons voted
                     him an annuity of £1000, to be continued to his immediate successor. On 16 July
                     Outram was promoted lieutenant-general. In October the City of London conferred
                     upon him its freedom and presented him with a sword of honour."</quote></note>

                     Charlotte Elizabeth, Countess Canning (1817–1861), courtier and vicereine of
                     India, was born at the British embassy in Paris on 31 March 1817, the elder of
                     the two daughters of Sir Charles Stuart, later Baron Stuart de Rothesay
                     (1779–1845), diplomatist, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Yorke (1789– 1867),
                     daughter of the third earl of Hardwicke. Like her sister Louisa [see Beresford,
                     Louisa, marchioness of Waterford], Charlotte Stuart was celebrated for her
                     beauty, piety, and artistic talent. Her appearance was enthusiastically
                     described in 1853: ‘She is very dark, with splendid eyes and rich black hair
                     and the most classic outline of head and face’ (Letters of the Hon. Mrs Edward
                     Twisleton, 139). At eighteen she married, on 5 September 1835, Charles John
                     Canning (1812–1862), only surviving son of the prime minister, George Canning,
                     and heir to his mother's viscountcy. [...] In June 1855 Lord Canning accepted
                     the post of governor-general of India. ‘[I] will not take any part in the
                     decision but only be ready to follow like a dog’ (Surtees, 193), his wife
                     wrote, rather dispiritedly. They left London in November, travelling to
                     Calcutta via Paris, Malta, and Egypt, pausing in Bombay, Ceylon, and Madras
                     before reaching their destination on 29 February 1856. [...] The year of the
                     Indian mutiny, 1857, put a tremendous emotional and physical strain on the
                     Cannings. Charlotte was kept well away from the dangerous areas, but she
                     gathered information assiduously, keeping the queen informed in detail of the
                     events as they unfolded, and was able to dispel some of the worst atrocity
                     stories: ‘there is not a particle of evidence of the poor women having been
                     “ill-used” anywhere’, she wrote (Surtees, 245). (Death, murder, starvation, and
                     the mutilation of corpses did not compare to the horror felt at the idea of
                     interracial rape.) To Lady Canning, the queen was able regularly to express her
                     complete confidence in the beleaguered Canning, who was under continual
                     pressure from the British at home and in India to exact a bloody retribution.
                     Canning was able to rely on his wife to communicate with his colleagues in
                     Britain when the pressures of the situation overwhelmed his correspondence.
                     Lord Granville read a letter of hers to the cabinet in October 1857, drawing
                     from the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, ‘a compliment at the expense of her
                     sex. “Ah, ah, a capital letter, unlike a lady's letter; it is all to the point,
                     ah, ah”’ (Fitzmaurice, 1.261). The revolt over, Canning was elevated to an
                     earldom, the government of India was removed from the hands of the East India
                     Company, and the governor-generalship was transformed into a viceroyalty. The
                     new vicereine travelled widely throughout India, from Madras in the south, to
                     the borders of Tibet in the north. She sketched and painted as she went, and
                     wrote detailed accounts of her travels to her family and to the queen. Despite
                     the difficulties, she had come to enjoy India, but was looking forward to her
                     frequently postponed return to England, which was set for January 1862. In
                     October 1861 she journeyed through Darjeeling, to the borders of Sikkim, and
                     saw Mount Everest, but her mind was on home and planning for the future there.
                     She returned to Calcutta on 8 November, clearly suffering from ‘jungle fever’,
                     or malaria. Four days later she was confined to bed, and shortly afterwards her
                     mind started wandering, and she died at 2.30 in the morning of 18
                     November."</quote></note>
