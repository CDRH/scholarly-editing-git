                        vessel in the Pylades class. The Admiralty ordered the ship on December 24,
                        1852. She was launched on November 23, 1854 and her masting and fitting-out
                        was completed on March 29, 1855. The length of the gundeck was 192 feet and
                        9 inches, the breadth at the broadest part of the ship was 38 feet, and the
                        depth in the hold was 23 feet and 11 inches. It is unclear how many men
                        served on Pylades class vessels, but <hi rend="italic">Jason</hi> class vessels (also 21-gun
                        Corvettes) carried 240 men (210). As David Lyon and Rif Winfield explain,
                        "Corvette designs were rapidly enlarged over the 1860s, as the corvette
                        began to take over the traditional frigate role of policing the high seas.
                        To this end they were all built as steam auxiliaries, designed to cruise
                        under sail" (207). The <hi rend="italic">Pylades</hi> was broken up for parts on January 23, 1875

                        inshore warfare duties during the Crimean War. The Admiralty ordered the
                        ship on July 26, 1855. She was launched on February 9, 1856, and her masting
                        and fitting-out was completed on April 7, 1856. She was 180 feet long, 28
                        feet at the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 14 feet. She was
                        built for a company of eighty men. As Lyon and Winfield explain, "The outbreak
                        of the Russian War demonstrated the need for numerous manoeuvrable,
                        shallow-draught vessels for coastal and inshore operations in the Baltic and
                        Black Seas. Six small screw steamers of the Arrow class were approved in
                        early 1854 to be built by contract in the Thames, initially classed as
                        despatch vessels. Twenty further vessels, to two designs rated as First

                        were ordered in 1855" (218). HMS <hi rend="italic">Sparrowhawk</hi> was sold at Esquimault in 1872.

                        she was the largest vessel in the world (244). She was 340 feet 5 inches

                        serve as auxiliaries, instead of the traditional practice of using elderly
                        warships; the majority of these were iron-hulled screw ships, which gave the

                    <desc>HMS <hi rend="italic">Megaera</hi> was a Royal Navy Iron screw frigate in the Magaera class,
                        which was a class of iron screw frigates converted to a troopship before
                        completion. She was launched on May 22, 1849 and her masting and fitting-out
                        was completed on December 29, 1851. She was 207 feet long, 37 feet 8 inches
                        at the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 24 feet 3 inches. She was
                        built for a company of 175 men (when intended as a frigate). As Lyon and
                        Winfield explain, "The success of a number of commercial shipyards in
                        Britain in building ships with iron hulls led the Admiralty in 1844 to
                        embark on a programme of four large iron frigates, to be fitted with screw
                        propulsion, each from a specialist merchant builder. However, the
                        Admiralty's confidence in iron ships was quickly shaken, following adverse
                        reports of damage to iron hulls under fire. on 1 December 1846 they enquired
                        as to the costs of cancelling the programme, and in April 1847 decided to
                        complete the four as troopships" (242). HMS <hi rend="italic">Megaera</hi> was beached on Saint
                        Paul's Island in the Indian Ocean on June 16, 1871 because of major leaks
                        rendering her unseaworthy due to corrosion of her plating (242).

                        the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 23 feet 11 inches. As Lyon
                        and Winfield explain, "Corvette designs were rapidly enlarged over the
                        1860s, as the corvette began to take over the traditional role of policing
                        the high seas. To this end they were all built as steam auxiliaries,
                        designed to cruise under sail" (207). HMS <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi> was sold to be broken up for

                        class (111). She was launched on May 16, 1843 and her masting and fitting
                        out was completed on September 1, 1843. She was 141 feet 2 inches long, 38
                        feet 10 inches at the broadest point, with a depth in the hold of 8 feet 9
                        inches. She was built for a company of 190 men (115). As Lyon and Winfield
                        explain, "Under the re-classing which took effect in February of 1817, the
                        smallest rated ships-the Sixth Rate-comprised vessels with 24 guns and above
                        but less than 36 guns. Typically, the post-war Sixth Rates were built as
                        28-gun ships; however, most were reduced to 26 guns in 1839. During the
                        1820s, a variety of designs from different sources were experimentally
                        tried, with differing hull forms being evaluated to try and achieve a fast
                        cruising performance. The French term 'corvette' came to be used for these
                        vessels, which were also referred to (disparagingly) as 'donkey frigates'
                        (111). <bibl><author>David Lyon and Rif
