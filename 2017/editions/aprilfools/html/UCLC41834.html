               To write, and ask your Autograph<br />

            <p>
               That was a memorable time<br />
                  You wrote in Prose, I wrote in Rhyme<br />
                  To describe the wonders of each place<br />
                  And the queer customs of each race<br />

At the outset of the <span class="italic">Quaker City</span> voyage Clemens described Cutter in his notebook as “fifty years old, &amp; small of his age. He dresses in homespun, &amp; is a simple minded, honest, old-fashioned farmer, with a strange proclivity for writing rhymes. He writes them on all possible subjects, &amp; gets them printed on slips of paper, with his portrait at the head. These he will give to any man that comes along, whether he has anything against him or not” (<span class="italic">N&J1</span>, 344). Cutter considered himself the Poet Laureate of the excursion. Clemens called him the “Poet Lariat” in <span class="italic">Innocents</span>, adopting Francis Eugene Andrews’s mispronunciation. In 1880 he called him a “mildewed idiot. His friends call him a lunatic—but that is pretty fulsome flattery; one cannot become a lunatic without first having brains” (30 Apr 1880 to Perkins, CtY-BR, in <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/" title="">MTPO</a>); 31 Mar and 1 Apr 69 to Fairbanks, <span class="italic">L2</span>, 185). In 1886 Cutter self-published a collection of his poems entitled <span class="italic">The Long Island Farmer's Poems</span>. His poems were never celebrated, yet he was a successful farmer: at his death his estate was worth $900,000.</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Samuel L. Clemens</b>  (1835–1910)
