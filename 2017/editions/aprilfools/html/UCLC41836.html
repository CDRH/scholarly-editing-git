            <p class="noindent">Mr. Mark Twain:</p>
        </p>
         <p style="text-indent:2em">I have been a devoted admirer of your works for the last sixty years. My life has been worth living ever since you began to write. Should you ever cease writing I should commit suicide on receiving the intelligence. Let me assure you, however, that I do not say these things to play upon your vanity. I do not believe you have any. No man who has the least spark of vanity could write your books</p>
           <p style="text-indent:2em">I implore you for your autograph. Do not, I beseech you, refuse my request. I have, already, 9,999. I want one more. Just one, dear, gentle, blessed St. Mark! This will reach you on the 1st of April. I shall expect an answer by the 3d. Yours passionately</p>

                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>George Washington Cable, a writer from New Orleans who fought for the Confederacy, was best known for his realist novels about Creole life such as <span class="italic">The Grandissimes: A Story of Creole Life</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Dr. Sevier</span> (1882). Having heard about Cable's work from William Dean Howells, Clemens met him in New Orleans in 1882, an encounter he described in chapters 44 and 47 of <span class="italic">Life on the Mississippi</span>. The winter following his April Fool joke he and Clemens went on their tour throughout the U.S. in which they alternated reading from their works. While the tour was a success, Clemens elaborated in a letter to Howells about his and Cable's "curious experience" together: "You will never never know, never divine, guess, imagine, how loathsome a thing the Christian religion can be made until you come to know &amp; study Cable daily &amp; hourly. Mind you, I like him; he is pleasant company; I rage &amp; swear at him sometimes, but we do not quarrel; we get along mighty happily together; but in him &amp; his person I have learned to hate all religions. He has taught me to abhor &amp; detest the Sabbath-day &amp; hunt up new &amp; troublesome ways to dishonor it" (27 February 1885 to William Dean Howells, MS in NN-BGC). Clemens may have been responsible for the rumors about Cable's stinginess during his stay with the Clemenses in the winter of 1884 that appeared in the Boston <span class="italic">Herald</span> on 7 May 1885; Clemens denied knowing anything about the "professional newspaper liar" when Cable asked him to refute the damaging story, and encouraged him to let it go. Cable did succeed in getting a retraction, but Clemens and Cable's relationship soured afterward (<span class="italic">N&J3</span>, 154).</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Samuel L. Clemens</b>  (1835–1910)
