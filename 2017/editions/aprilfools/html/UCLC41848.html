                    <p>Dear Mr. Clemens,</p>
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent:3em">During a recent trip in Italy your "Innocence Abroad" was my constant companion, &amp; having often heard my father<a class="superscript alteration" id="text_note1" onclick="selectNote('note1');" onmouseout="unliteNote('note1');" onmouseover="hiliteNote('note1');">1</a> speak of your interest in the propagation of literature among the youth of this country as well as of your benevolent spirit I am now going to ask your interest &amp; help in a project which has been for some time in my mind. I am very anxious to begin the foundation of a library of American works &amp; especially of such books as treat of their author's first impressions in European or other foreign countries. If therefore you would donate, as a beginning, a full set of your works with your name written clearly in each, I should consider myself very fortunate. I would also be very glad to have a duplicate copy of the "Innocence Abroad" in as compact a form as possible, for I travel a great deal &amp; heavy volumes are inconvenient to pack. It is understood of course that I should like your name also in this. Thanking you in advance for the kindness which I am sure you will show I am
