            <p style="text-indent:2em">It would be too long to tell you how it all came about, nor is my memory clear as to the details. I may have been partaking of his hospitality or I may not. Whether I had or not, as I tell you, my memory is not clear as to details, but of this cardinal fact I am clear in my recollection, and the insult has [been] rankling in my bosom for more than a month:—he called me a “Cape Cod Turkey.”<a class="superscript alteration" id="text_note2" onclick="selectNote('note2');" onmouseout="unliteNote('note2');" onmouseover="hiliteNote('note2');">2</a></p>

R. Osgood &amp; Co. in 1885. The first book he published for Mark Twain was <span class="italic">A True Story, and The Recent Carnival of Crime</span> (1872), followed nearly a decade later by <span class="italic">The Prince and the Pauper</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">The Stolen White Elephant</span> (1882). In 1882 he accompanied Clemens on a return trip along the great river to gather material for <span class="italic">Life on the Mississippi,</span> which Osgood marketed so poorly that Clemens never published with him again. At this time Clemens and Osgood were still squabbling about the poor returns from <span class="italic">Life on the Mississippi</span>. See, for instance, Osgood to SLC, 26 March 1884 (MS in CU-MARK). Clemens noted the following book-keeping discrepancies in his notebook: "About middle October, '83,  Osgood owed  me $33,250. T[---] Paid me $5,000 by check. Gave me acceptances at 3 months from Oct 15, for $5,000, $10,000 &amp; $5,000 ($20,000. Leaving $8,250 unprovided for (NB 22)."</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note5"><p class="footnote"><a name="an005"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">5</span> Clemens knew Waring as early as 1875, when they socialized together in Newport (see SLC to Waring, 14 July 1875). Waring's association with Cable began In 1880, when Waring was sent to New Orleans to collect social statistics for the tenth Census. He contacted Cable to help him by adding historical material, having read and enjoyed <span class="italic">Creole Days</span> on the train en route. Waring remained a strong supporter of Cable, both by introducing him to his publisher, Osgood, to whom Cable promised <span class="italic">Dr. Sevier</span> (despite a firm relationship with Scribber's &amp; Sons), and during his first lecture tour in 1883. Waring, along with Gilder, Warner and Clemens, sat on the dais at his Hartford performance.</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />MS, Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California,
