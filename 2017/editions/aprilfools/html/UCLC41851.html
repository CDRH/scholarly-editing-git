Late in life he suffered from Bright's disease, and his diminished mental capacities led to accusations of insanity. Josiah Gilbert Holland (1819–91) was a writer nationally renowned for his advice books who also wrote under the pen name “Timothy Titcomb.” He was also a co-founder of <span class="italic">Scribner's Monthly</span>, and he not only admired but personally encouraged Emily Dickinson and her poetry. "Barry Gray" was the pen name for Robert Barry Coffin (1826–86), author of <span class="italic">Out of Town, A Rural Episode</span>, among other books. He was a frequenter of Pfaff's cellar in New York City, where he was known to associate with the likes of Artemus Ward and Walt Whitman. Later in life he worked as a clerk at the New York Customs House, where he befriended fellow employee Herman Melville, to whom he affectionately inscribed four of his books ("Old 'Barry Gray' Dead," New York <span class="italic">World</span>, 12 June 1886, 5; <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 418). “General” Daniel Pratt, Jr. (1809–1887) was a prolific author and lecturer who was known to ostentatiously introduce himself as "the great American traveler!" (see, for example, “Some Hit And Miss Chat,” New York <span class="italic">Times</span> 7 September 1885, 2). "Count Joannes" was the stage name for George Jones (1810–79), an English-born actor who became a prominent (and outlandish) lecturer in the United States after an 1864 appearance at the Cooper Institute. Charles Guiteau (1841–82) assassinated Grover Cleveland but was also a failed writer.</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />The Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley (CU-MARK).</p><div><h2>Persons Mentioned</h2><p><b>Thomas Bailey  Aldrich</b>  (1836–1907)

                        stories about New Hampshire, where he was born and raised, including his novel <span class="italic">The Story of a Bad Boy</span>, which was a forerunner for <span class="italic">Tom Sawyer</span>. He served on the
                     editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Evening Mirror</span>, <span class="italic">Home Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">Saturday Press</span>. From 1861
                     until 1862 he served as Civil War correspondent for the New York <span class="italic">Tribune</span>. In 1865 he married Lilian Woodman and moved to
                     Boston, where James R. Osgood had offered him the editorship of <span class="italic">Every Saturday</span>, a post he held until 1874. He succeeded
                     William Dean Howells as editor of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1881, a position he
                     retained until 1890. While Clemens was not initially enthusiastic about Aldrich's
                     work, he often provided advice (see his 15 and 16, 24, 25 March 1874 letter
                     suggesting changes in his novel <span class="italic">Prudence Palfrey</span>, <span class="italic">L6</span>, 74–82, 89–95). They remained lifelong
                     friends. In his 1904 sketch “Robert Louis Stevenson and Thomas Bailey Aldrich,”
                     Clemens wrote that Aldrich “never had his peer for prompt and pithy and witty
                     and humorous sayings” (<a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10362.xml;doc.view=;chunk.id=d1e9377;toc.id=0;style=work;brand=mtp" title=""><span class="italic">AutoMT1</span>, 229</a>, 539 n.
