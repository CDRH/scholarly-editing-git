Duncan's libel suit, filed in June 1883, sought $100,000 in damages on account of Henry Alloway's 10 June 1883 interview with Mark Twain in the New York <span class="italic">Times</span>, which insulted Duncan's morality and abilities as a captain, and applauded Elihu Root's investigation into Duncan's finances as Shipping Commissioner. SLC denied the correctness of anything that was printed in the <span class="italic">Times</span>, although during his deposition he did admit to some aspects of the interview that were intended as jokes, and, as he coyly said, "I do not usually say under oath what I say in a newspaper article" (Brooklyn <span class="italic">Eagle</span>, 7 March 1884, 4). The verdict, which awarded Duncan twelve cents, implied that the New York <span class="italic">Times</span> had good reason to print the Mark Twain interview because of Duncan's evident corruption, as the Brooklyn <span class="italic">Eagle</span> editorialized: "Technically the <span class="italic">Times</span> was guilty of libel, no doubt, but to perfectly unbiased minds the system upon which the office is conducted merited the comments published concerning it. Captain Duncan was manifestly less concerned for the United States and the sailor man than for Captain Duncan and his progeny" (Brooklyn <span class="italic">Eagle</span>, 9 March 1884, 6).</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />The Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley (CU-MARK).</p><div><h2>Persons Mentioned</h2><p><b>Charles C.

Duncan had gone to sea as a boy and was a ship captain before he was thirty. In 1853 he became a shipping and commission merchant in New York City, operating as Charles C. Duncan and Company. Shortly before the Civil War, he resettled in England and resumed business there while leaving the New York office in the hands of a subordinate, who absconded with the firm’s funds, precipitating its bankruptcy after Duncan’s return in 1865. The <span class="italic">Quaker City</span> excursion was in part a means of recovering from the bankruptcy. Duncan also lectured on the excursion, in New York on 3 and 26 December 1867, in Washington on January 1868, in Cleveland on 10 March 1868, and again in New York on 11 January 1877, when he attacked Clemens by declaring <span class="italic">Innocents</span> was “in no sense” an accurate account of the trip (“About Mark Twain,” New York <span class="italic">World</span>, 12 Jan 1877, 5). Clemens showed his contempt for Duncan in his partial draft of a <span class="italic">Quaker City</span> play, depicting him as the mercenary “Capt. Dusenberry” (see Appendix E of <span class="italic">L2</span>; also the enclosure (note 1) of Clemens's <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL00160.xml;query=quaker%20city%20play;searchAll=;sectionType1=;sectionType2=;sectionType3=;sectionType4=;sectionType5=;style=letter;brand=mtp#1" title="">25 November 1867 letter to Charles Henry Webb</a>. Over the years he and Duncan were intermittently contentious, specifically in 1877 and 1883, when Clemens spoke out in support of Elihu Root's corruption investigation (<a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL00174.xml;doc.view=;style=letter;brand=mtp" title="">8 January 68 to Beach</a>, <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL00200.xml;doc.view=;style=letter;brand=mtp" title="">10 March 68 to Fairbanks</a>, L2, 149 n. 6, 203 n. 1; N&J2, 35; N&J3, 18, 24–25).
