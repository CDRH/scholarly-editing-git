Tupper, best known for his long series of blank-verse meditations <span class="italic">Proverbial Philosophy</span> (1867–1876), though popular, was considered a paragon of banality and sentimentalism by the literati of Clemens's circle. Clemens on several occasions made Tupper the butt of a joke in his correspondence and in his writings. As early as 1865 Clemens passed on an indictment of his poetry by a Harper's editor: “Don't poor Martin Tupper Farquhar fondle his platitudes and think they are poems?”  In <span class="italic">The Gilded Age</span>, his name was given to a sickly but sweet lapdog. In notes for a speech in Montreal in 1881 he jotted down a joke stating that in England Tupper is known as Solomon-&-Water (brandy and soda).</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note3"><p class="footnote"><a name="an0003"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">3</span>In his letter to the <span class="italic">Biographical Record of the Class of 1874 in Yale College</span> (1912), Jenkins claimed Clemens, Warner, Hutton, amd Stedman amongst the many friends and acquaintainces he gained through his friendship with Henry Ward Beecher (p. 129).</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />MS, Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California,

                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>Jenkins was born in Boontown, N.J. and graduated from Yale in 1874. He moved to New York, where he boarded with fellow April Fool letter writer Horatio C. King, and through that connection soon became Henry Ward Beecher's secretary. He was connected with the <span class="italic">Christian Union</span> in various capacities, including as publisher from 1878–1879, and then joined a banking firm in 1879, advancing to senior partner. However, the firm went into receivership in 1890. After two more failed ventures in managing mines in Minnesota and Cuba, he formed the Jenkins Coal Company. Through his association with Beecher and his memberships in the Lambs and Players Clubs he formed acquaintances with Warner, Hutton, Stedman, and Clemens, as he claims in his letter to the Yale alumni club. Clemens's annotation identifies him as a “stranger” in 1884. Jenkins never married. He died of Bright's disease at his home in the Hotel Ansonia in 1913.</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Samuel L.
