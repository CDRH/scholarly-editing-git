            <p style="text-indent:2em">I have an idea of following the prevailing fashion, and starting an autograph book: and by way of benediction to the enterprise, I wish to begin with yours. I may never get beyond that: but even then I shall have half ended what was so well begun. If you can find nothing better to do therefore, do sit down and dash me off  something characteristic and brilliant and meanwhile believe me</p>

He met Clemens in the early 1870s, and remained good friends with him until his death. During this time he was also employed as the literary editor of the New York <span class="italic">World</span>. They both belonged to the American Copyright League and the Authors Club. About his friendship with Clemens Hawthorne recalled that "I found him as most people did, delightful and fruitful, and very much as he was in his best writing," adding that "He never seemed to be a very happy man ... his mind was too active, searching out and sincere not to be troubled by the riddle of the Universe" ("Mark Twain as I Knew Him," <span class="italic">Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine</span> 87 [April 1929]: 111).</p></div><br /></p></div></div></div></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
