                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>John Hay was a writer and statesman who grew up in Warsaw, Illinois, a small
                     town about sixty miles from Clemens's hometown of Hannibal, Missouri, and this
                     common background fostered their long friendship. After graduating from Brown
                     University, Hay began his illustrious career in public service as an assistant
                     private secretary to Abraham Lincoln. Hay met Clemens in the late 1860s, and in 1871 Clemens offered Hay
                     part-ownership of the Buffalo <span class="italic">Express</span>, and to join him
                     in a trip down the Mississippi to furnish material for what would appear in
                     1875 as the "Old Times on the Mississippi" series in the January-June and
                     August issues of the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>. Hay declined both
                     offers, but remained appreciative of his work (see
                     also <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL11849.xml;query=john%20hay;searchAll=;sectionType1=;sectionType2=;sectionType3=;sectionType4=;sectionType5=;style=letter;brand=mtp#1" title="">Clemens to John M. Hay, 6? Jan 1871</a>). Clemens also appreciated Hay's <span class="italic">Pike County Ballads</span> (1871) for its verisimilitude to
                        their boyhood region. In 1870 Hay accepted an editorial
                     position on the New York <span class="italic">Tribune</span> under Horace Greeley,
                     and then, after Greeley’s death in 1872, assisted the new editor, Whitelaw
                     Reid. He gave up his <span class="italic">Tribune</span> position in 1875 and pursued a literary career as
                     a poet, novelist, and biographer of Lincoln. Until about 1890 Hay's friendship with Clemens was
                     was lukewarm, kept up mostly through mutual friends, but their relationship
                     changed in 1898, when Hay became Secretary of State under the McKinley (and
                     later Rossevelt) administration. Despite Clemens's anti-imperialist polemics (and
                     Hay's support for Clemens's foe Theodore Roosevelt), their affection for each other
                     remained solid until Hay's death in 1905 (see <a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10362.xml;chunk.id=d1e9201;toc.depth=1;toc.id=;citations=;style=work;brand=mtp#X" title=""><span class="italic">AutoMT1</span>, pp.222-24</a>). In a 27 August 1907
                     autobiographical dictation Clemens reminisced, "Hay was a man of great and varied
                     talents and accomplishments, and was conspicuously well equipped for the
                     several great national and international posts which he had filled in his
                     brilliant career; and he climbed to several of them without the help of wealth,
                     and would doubtless have climbed the rest of the way without that help, and all
                     the public would have approved, and would also have affectionately applauded
                     and rejoiced" (<a href="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10364.xml;query=%22john%20hay%22;chunk.id=dv0028;toc.depth=1;toc.id=;citations=;style=work;brand=mtp#3" title=""><span class="italic">AutoMT3</span>, p. 112</a>).</p></div><br /></p></div></div></div></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
