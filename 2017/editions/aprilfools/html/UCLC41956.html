                  Irving, along with his leading lady Ellen Terry and the Lyceum Company, were closing out their second American Tour. March 31st was opening night for a 24-night run at Lester Wallack's Star Theatre, featuring scenes from <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span>, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">Louis XI,</span> <span class="italic">Charles I</span>, <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and <span class="italic">The Lyons Mail</span>. (Advertisements, New York <span class="italic">Sun</span>, 24 March 1884, 4; 12 April 1884, 4; and 22 April 1884, 4.)

Joseph Hatton (1837-1907) was an English journalist, novelist and playwright, and a biographer of English actors Irving and Toole. He had met Clemens during his English sojourn in 1872-3, and recounts how at a dinner at Hezekiah Batemen's house a prominent tragedian (most likely Irving) delivered a humorous anecdote, which Hatton praised as “good English humour.” Sometime later while reading Mark Twain's <span class="ita;ic">Sketches</span>, he discovered that Irving had retold a Mark Twain anecdote (Hatton, <span class="italic">To-day in America: Studies for the Old World and the New</span> (1881), 53. In 1884 Hatton was accompanying Irving on his second American tour as a buffer between Irving and the press, conducting his own interviews of the great tragedian in various cities on the tour. The collection of these interviews, along with scraps of gossip and travelogue, was published by Osgood in May 1884 as <span class="italic">Irving's Impressions of America</span>. </span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note3"><p class="footnote"><a name="an003"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">3</span>Clemens socialized with Irving and Hatton at the home of Hezekiah Bateman while on his English tour of 1872–3.

Upon hearing of Irving's death Clemens sent the following telegram: “All our people mourn him. He earned their love &amp; esteem at at his first coming &amp; never lost it. He was endeared to me by a warm friendship of thirty-three years” (SLC to Macalister, 17 October 1905).</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />MS, Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California,

In 1871 he joined the Lyceum Theatre in London under the management of Hezekiah Bateman, where he won acclaim for his performance in <span class="italic">The Bells</span>, an adaptation of Erckmann-Chatrian's <span class="italic">Le Juif Polonais</span>. He took over the management of the Lyceum Theatre from Batemen in 1878, the beginning of his long stage and personal partnership with Ellen Terry. In 1895 he became the first actor to receive a knighthood. During a provincial farewell tour in Bradford he was taken ill and died of a stroke hours later.</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Samuel L.
