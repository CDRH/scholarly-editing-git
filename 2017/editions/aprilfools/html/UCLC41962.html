C. <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, 22 Mar 1881, 1). Knox's service consisted mainly of his positive depiction of Siam in  <span class="italic">The Boy Travelers in Siam and Java</span> (1882). Chulalongkorn (1853-1910) was the fifth King of Siam of the Chakri Dynasty, who ruled from 1868 to his death in 1910. He is credited with promoting significant social and political reforms, as well as with keeping western expansionist powers at bay.</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note2"><p class="footnote"><a name="an0002"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">2</span>At the time of this letter the King had produced some 45 children by nearly as many consorts.

His war letters were collected in 1866 as <span class="italic">Campfire and Cottonfields</span>. After the war he traveled as a <span class="italic">Herald</span> correspondent with the Russo-American Telegraph Company to build the first telegraph line across Siberia. In 1870 the American Publishing Company published these letters as <span class="italic">Overland Through Asia</span>. In 1877 he traveled around the world, gathering material for his series of travel books. The series list serves as an itinerary for his travels. In 1881 the King of Siam conferred upon him a knighthood in the Order of the White Elephant in return for his service to the country. He was the first American to receive that honor. Knox, who never married, made his home at the Lotos Club and was club secretary from 1880–89. He was also a member of the Authors Club.</p></div><br /></p></div></div></div></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
