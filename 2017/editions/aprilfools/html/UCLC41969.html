Florence and his wife: “11 p.m. Thursday, charm &amp; oysters (CU-MARK).” American stage actor William J. Florence (1831-91) was born William Jermyn Conlin of Irish immigrant parents in Albany, N.Y. He specialized in comic roles, often in Irish or German vernacular, and often co-starring with his wife, Annie Malvina Pray (1830-1906). Their biggest hit, <span class="italic">The Mighty Dollar</span>, opened in 1875 and toured until 1889.</span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />MS, Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California,

He was rumored to have been murdered there shortly after his escape, but apparently lived in Mexico until shortly before he died in Tucson, Arizona, in 1905. The Beach family of Hartford were financial supporters of both companies, and Charles M. Beach was appointed receiver for the Union Mfg Co. Plunkett was a member of the Hartford Club. His father, Massachusetts politician Thomas F. Plunkett (senior), had been a member of the Monday Evening Club.</p></div><br /></p></div></div></div></div><br class="clear"/></div></body></html>
