The two were great friends, and commiserated together in a lively correspondence. (Bradlaugh, General Correspondence and Papers, 1870–1879, National Secular Society (&lt;https:/www.britishonlinearchives.co.uk/browse.php?did=72979-C05&gt;. See also Adolphe S. Headingley, <span class="italic">Biography of Charles Bradlaugh</span>, London: Remington &amp; Co., 1880, 254–60).</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note3"><p class="footnote"><a name="an003"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">3</span>English essayist, literary and cultural critic, and poet Matthew Arnold (1822–88) made his first North American lecture tour in 1883–84 to pronounce upon the state of American culture in four platform speeches. Arnold's critique of American society was published in <span class="italic">Civilization in the United States. First and Last Impressions of America</span> (1888). His indictment: <div class="blockquote">In truth everything is against distinction in America, and against the sense of elevation to be gained through admiring and respecting it. The glorification of 'the average man,' who is quite a religion with statesmen and publicists there, is against it. The addiction to 'the funny man,' who is a national misfortune there, is against it. Above all, the newspapers are against it. It is often said that every nation has the government it deserves. What is much more certain is that every nation has the newspapers it deserves (p. 177).</div> Lorettus Metcalf, editor of <span class="italic">The Forum</span>, invited Clemens to respond to Arnold's attacks (Metcalf to Clemens, 10 Apr 1888, CU-MARK), but Clemens's original rebuttal “English Criticism on America” (MS, CU-MARK) was never published, despite earlier direct provocation. Previously, in “A Word About America", published in <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century</span> 11 (May 1882): 689–90, Arnold had attacked “the Quinionian humor of Mr. Mark Twain” as an index of the intellectual crudeness of Americans: “These childish and half-savage minds are not moved except by very elementary narratives composed without art, in which burlesque and melodrama, vulgarity and eccentricity, are combined in strong doses.”</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note4"><p class="footnote"><a name="an004"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">4</span>Richard D'Oyly Carte (1844–1901) was an English composer, impressario, and hotelier. He was a proponent of a new school of respectable (not risque) English comic opera. To that end he brought together William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, and built the Savoy Theatre in which to present their works. With returns from his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan he was able to build the Savoy Hotel, the first luxury hotel in London with electric lights and elevators. In 1890 the partnership amongst Carte, Gilbert, and Sullivan was dissolved over a lawsuit brought by Gilbert for mishandling finances. Carte turned his attentions to the construction of The Royal English Opera House, whose first production was Sullivan's opera <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1891). Though the piece was successful, the enterprise failed, and Carte sold the theater at a loss. In short order he added Claridge's and the Grand Hotel in Rome to his business portfolio, to stave off his theatrical losses. Carte continued to produce the occasional opera by both Gilbert and Sullivan at the Savoy until his death in 1901.</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note5"><p class="footnote"><a name="an005"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">5</span>Arthur Seymour Sullivan (1842–1900) was an English composer of diverse works, and collaborator with William S.

He became an instant celebrity in England in the early 1870s, more for his colorful appearance and personality than for his writings.</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note11"><p class="footnote"><a name="an011"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">11</span>American newspaper editor and diplomat Whitelaw Reid (1837–1912) became owner and editor of the New York <span class="italic">Tribune</span> after the death of Horace Greeley. He served as Ambassador to France (1889), Special Ambassador to the Coronation of King Edward XII (1902), and was the 35th American Ambassador to the United Kingdom (1905–12). Clemens and Reid were corresponding as early as 1869, but their acquaintance began to sour as early as 1873 when Reid refused to allow Clemens's friend Edward House to review the <span class="italic">The Gilded Age</span>. By 1883 Clemens was in full fettle, composing a vindictive “Biography of Whitelaw Reid,” and recruiting evidence from John Russell Young and others concerning Reid's alleged calumny against Clemens (see NB 20, <span class="italic">N&J</span>, 439–45).  Pond may have been aware of Clemens's dislike of Reid. Clemens noted in one of his journals that Ulysses S. Grant also used this epithet, and was perhaps the source of it: “Grant calls him  Outlaw Reid.” (NB 19, N&J2, 420).</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note12"><p class="footnote"><a name="an012"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">12</span>Humorist and lecturer Melville DeLancey Landon (1839–1910) wrote columns under the pseudonym Eli Perkins for the New York <span class="italic">Commercial Advertiser</span> in the 1870s. He had been secretary to the St. Petersburg legation for Cassius Clay, Minister to Russia. Upon returning to the United States in 1871 he published a documentary history of the Franco-Prussian War. He was a close friend of humorist Artemus Ward, and edited the latter's complete works. Clemens's distaste for Landon's brand of humor is revealed in the marginalia in his copy of Perkins's <span class="italic">Saratoga in 1901</span> (1871), which he labels “[t]he droolings of an idiot” on the flyleaf.</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note13"><p class="footnote"><a name="an013"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">13</span>Tony Pastor (1832–1908) was an American variety performer and impressario, known as The Father of Vaudeville.

Cable lay sick abed at the Clemens home for nearly three weeks, during which time Pond sent several desperate and incredulous telegrams inquiring after Cable's health. On 28 January Clemens and Cable's doctor dispatched at least four telegrams to Pond confirming his continuing indisposition. Clemens's 31 January letter to Pond, assuring him that Cable was not malingering, was published by the Chicago <span class="italic">Tribune</span> on 3 February and the New York <span class="italic">Times</span> on the next day.</span></p></div><div class="altnote" id="note15"><p class="footnote"><a name="an00015"></a><span class="small"><span class="superscript">15</span>The arrangement of this list, sandwiched between Victor Hugo and Buffalo Bill Cody, serves as a short compendium of the highlights of any good collection: foreign authors, politicians, critics, impressarios, followed by American civil rights activists Garrison, Phillips, and Stowe.

                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>George Washington Cable, a writer from New Orleans who fought for the Confederacy, was best known for his realist novels about Creole life such as <span class="italic">The Grandissimes: A Story of Creole Life</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Dr. Sevier</span> (1882). Having heard about Cable's work from William Dean Howells, Clemens met him in New Orleans in 1882, an encounter he described in chapters 44 and 47 of <span class="italic">Life on the Mississippi</span>. The winter following his April Fool joke he and Clemens went on their tour throughout the U.S. in which they alternated reading from their works. While the tour was a success, Clemens elaborated in a letter to Howells about his and Cable's "curious experience" together: "You will never never know, never divine, guess, imagine, how loathsome a thing the Christian religion can be made until you come to know &amp; study Cable daily &amp; hourly. Mind you, I like him; he is pleasant company; I rage &amp; swear at him sometimes, but we do not quarrel; we get along mighty happily together; but in him &amp; his person I have learned to hate all religions. He has taught me to abhor &amp; detest the Sabbath-day &amp; hunt up new &amp; troublesome ways to dishonor it" (27 February 1885 to William Dean Howells, MS in NN-BGC). Clemens may have been responsible for the rumors about Cable's stinginess during his stay with the Clemenses in the winter of 1884 that appeared in the Boston <span class="italic">Herald</span> on 7 May 1885; Clemens denied knowing anything about the "professional newspaper liar" when Cable asked him to refute the damaging story, and encouraged him to let it go. Cable did succeed in getting a retraction, but Clemens and Cable's relationship soured afterward (<span class="italic">N&J3</span>, 154).</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Henry Ward  Beecher</b>  (1813–1887)
                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>Henry Ward Beecher was the renowned liberal pastor of Plymouth Church in
                       Brooklyn, and the author of several popular books. He was also a social activist who promoted abolition, temperance, and women's rights. Clemens met him in the winter of 1868, and admired his congeniality even when pointing out his flimsy convictions (which would culminate in the Beecher-Tilton adultery trial of 1875). Clemens also published the sketch "Rev. Henry Ward Beecher's Farm," which was published in <span class="italic">Sketches</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">A Curious Dream</span> (1872). They exchanged letters and kept a mostly pleasant acqaintance; Clemens usually saw him when he visited his sister Isabella Hooker, who was Clemens's neighbor in Hartford and a very close friend. A tricky publishing venture at the end of Beecher's life also revealed Clemens's ambivalence to the celebrity pastor. On 3 January 1887 Charles Webster informed Clemens that Beecher was considering an autobiography: “Beecher seemed to think that it might be a pretty good thing to do, and he also seemed to think that other things being equal, he would rather have us publish it than any one else. ... I do not love Beecher any more than you do, but I love his money just as well, and I am certain that that book would sell.” (Beecher had also been advanced a substantial sum by Webster to complete his <span class="italic">Jesus, Life of the Christ</span>, which he also did not finish.) Beecher's death complicated these publishing plans, and in 1888 Clemens settled for the unprofitable biography completed by his son William and son-in-law Samuel Scoville (<span class="italic">N&J3</span>, 272, 276).</p></div><br /></p><p><b>James B.

By 1884 he had managed Henry Ward Beecher, Wendell Phillips, Matthew Arnold, and George Washington Cable.
