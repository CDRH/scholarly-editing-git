	      <p>My Dear Mr. Twain,</p>
	    </p>
             <p style="text-indent:2em">Having seen accounts of the “job” Geo. W. Cable put up on you, I too ask you for your Autograph. I want a <span class="italic">patent-double back-cut and cum agin</span> concern. (I want it for a blind man). I am glad that you are dramatising “The Prince and The Pauper,” which I have had the pleasure and honor to read; I think I like it better than any book I ever have read. Would certainly like to see it “played” I am a boy—something of a “Galoot”, and about 18 years old. Yes Mr. Clemens I think you one of the best writers in the country.</p>

Vandiver had so signed himself in his first letter (of four) to Clemens (Vandiver to SLC, 18 February 1884, CU-MARK), in which he asked Clemens for a set of all his books. Clemens's annotation on the envelope of that first letter reads: “Another Southern beggar.” </span></p></div><br class="clear" /><br class="clear" /><h2>Textual Commentary</h2><p class="noindgap"><img alt="glyph" class="glyph" src="icons/ts_endprf.gif" /><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" /><i>Copy-text:</i><img alt="glyph" class="en-space" src="icons/blank.gif" />MS, Mark Twain Papers, The Bancroft Library, University of California,

                                                    <br /><div class="normal"><p>George Washington Cable, a writer from New Orleans who fought for the Confederacy, was best known for his realist novels about Creole life such as <span class="italic">The Grandissimes: A Story of Creole Life</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Dr. Sevier</span> (1882). Having heard about Cable's work from William Dean Howells, Clemens met him in New Orleans in 1882, an encounter he described in chapters 44 and 47 of <span class="italic">Life on the Mississippi</span>. The winter following his April Fool joke he and Clemens went on their tour throughout the U.S. in which they alternated reading from their works. While the tour was a success, Clemens elaborated in a letter to Howells about his and Cable's "curious experience" together: "You will never never know, never divine, guess, imagine, how loathsome a thing the Christian religion can be made until you come to know &amp; study Cable daily &amp; hourly. Mind you, I like him; he is pleasant company; I rage &amp; swear at him sometimes, but we do not quarrel; we get along mighty happily together; but in him &amp; his person I have learned to hate all religions. He has taught me to abhor &amp; detest the Sabbath-day &amp; hunt up new &amp; troublesome ways to dishonor it" (27 February 1885 to William Dean Howells, MS in NN-BGC). Clemens may have been responsible for the rumors about Cable's stinginess during his stay with the Clemenses in the winter of 1884 that appeared in the Boston <span class="italic">Herald</span> on 7 May 1885; Clemens denied knowing anything about the "professional newspaper liar" when Cable asked him to refute the damaging story, and encouraged him to let it go. Cable did succeed in getting a retraction, but Clemens and Cable's relationship soured afterward (<span class="italic">N&J3</span>, 154).</p></div><br /></p><p><b>Samuel L. Clemens</b>  (1835–1910)
