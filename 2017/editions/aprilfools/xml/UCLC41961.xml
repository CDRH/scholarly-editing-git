             <p rend="text-indent:2">My mother-in-law<note xml:id="an0001" place="foot" type="an" n="1">His mother-in-law was Susan Coit Belcher Thomson (1809-1890), a descendant of Revolutionary War captain William Belcher. She married Dr. Charles Steele Thomson, and together they produced seven children, the &#x201C;large and gifted family&#x201D; to which Kinney refers. In an obituary for her son she was characterized as follows: "She was familiar with the best authors of her time, and her correspondence was with persons of cultivation and character" (Leonard J. Sanford, "William Henry Thomson, M.D.," in <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Connecticut Medical Society, 1894</hi> [Bridgeport: Stiles and Tucker, 1894], 245).</note> has a fine collection of autographs, the educational and moral effect of which has been of very great service in raising to maturity a large and gifted family.<note xml:id="an0002" place="foot" type="an" n="2">Susan and Charles Steele Thomson, M.D., produced seven children, two of whom became physicians. Kinney's wife, Sara, was very active in the social circles of the Daughters of the American Revolution and Mayflower descendants.</note> But she finds she has run too much to statesmen, clergymen and moral reformers, and to fill a long felt want desires to secure a supply of noted criminals, aesthetes and thoughtful democrats. I want very much to secure for her benefit one of your most powerful signatures. I am not particular about having it written by the type-writer or by telephone<note xml:id="an0003" place="foot" type="an" n="3">As a close friend of Clemens, Kinney may have been aware of Clemens's recently invented strategy of foiling autograph seekers by the use of the typewriter.</note>—all I insist upon is that it shall be characteristic, and, if possible, upon a cheque.<note xml:id="an0004" place="foot" type="an" n="4">This device was reprised a few weeks later in a begging letter seeking funding for a periodical for young folks by a southern editor who had most likely read the precis of Kinney's joke in the newspaper accounts. See Annie M. Barnes to SLC, 3 June 1884 (CU-MARK).</note></p>
