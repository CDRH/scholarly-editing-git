               <salute>My Dear Mr. Clemens,</salute>
            </opener>
             <p rend="text-indent:2">It has long been one of my regrets that your face was not included either in any of the series of postage stamps issued by the government or in that of the Atlantic Portraits.<note xml:id="an0001" place="foot" type="an" n="1">By 1884 the complete set of six Atlantic Portraits, those of Longfellow, Whittier, Bryant, Holmes, Lowell, and Emerson, was complete. In 1879 Scudder edited a collection based on the poems of this group: <hi rend="italic">American Poems: Longfellow: Whittier: Bryant: Holmes: Lowell: Emerson.</hi></note> The latter would be preferable for there is no gum game about them and I always carry them about me in a neat card case.<note type="an" xml:id="an0002" place="foot" n="2">Life-size portraits were available with subscriptions to the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>. No evidence has been found for card-case-sized portraits.</note> I like to collect portraits of literary men, and when I can get them in characteristic form I am more than pleased. I have <pb facs="facs/scudder02.jpg" xml:id="pb0002" n="2"/>that of Dr. Holmes in which he is standing by a breakfast table in the favorite attitude of Shakespeare leaning on his monument,<note type="an" xml:id="an0003" place="foot" n="3">Scudder is referring to Holmes's <hi rend="italic">The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</hi> (1858), a collection of <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> essays published in book form.</note> and I am glad to say that I have that very animated one in which you are grasping the hand of <name>Mr. Raymond</name><note type="an" xml:id="an004" place="foot" n="4">John T. Raymond (1836-87), born John O'Brien, was an American stage actor who specialized in comic roles. In 1874 he starred in an unauthorized dramatic production of the <hi rend="italic">Gilded Age</hi> produced by <hi rend="italic">Golden Era</hi> drama critic Gilbert B. Densmore in San Francisco. Clemens stopped production, purchased the script, and revised the play, which opened in New York as &#x201C;Colonel Sellers&#x201D; in the fall of 1874. Though not entirely a critical success, the play was immensely popular, and Raymond toured with it for more than a decade. In 1884 Clemens and Howells were collaborating on a second Sellers play, but could not entice Raymond to accept the leading role until much later.</note> in the characteristically cordial manner which does you so much honor.<note type="an" place="foot" xml:id="an0005" n="5">The photograph, by George Rockwood, was taken in 1874, as publicity for the <hi rend="italic">Gilded Age Play</hi>, in which Raymond played the lead role of Col. Sellers. At the time of the April Fool joke co-authors Clemens and William Dean Howells were in a contract dispute with Raymond over terms for securing Raymond to play the lead in the second Col. Sellers play.</note> Now I want to ask the favor of you that you would add a few words to this picture—just say in your forcible English or American—I can read both languages—what you are thinking of when you were in that attitude. I want in short a holograph—I think that is what they call it, something full of meaning, not a mere empty autograph, though the spoken word might mislead a less educated man than you are, or I am. This letter for instance is a holograph.</p>
            <p rend="text-indent:2">I don’t like to trust the picture to the mail, for you to write beneath it, or on its back, but I would be glad if you would make your sentiment on a piece of bristol board six inches by nine,—the nine to go the long way—and pack it carefully between some stiff boards, and send it by mail. Be careful to put on letter postage for unless you have a proof sheet with it, it can’t go by newspaper mail.
