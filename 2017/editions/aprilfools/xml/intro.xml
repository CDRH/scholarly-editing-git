  <head>Introduction, Mark Twain: April Fool, 1884</head>
  <byline>by Leslie Myrick and Christopher Ohge</byline>


	<p rend="noindent">Filed away among the more than 16,000 incoming letters in the Mark Twain Papers in Berkeley, California, is a small cache of 78 letters, all written between 28 March and 6 April 1884 and asking for Mark Twain's autograph. Letters from autograph seekers make up a surprising, and as yet uncalculated, portion of Mark Twain's extant incoming mail. What distinguishes these particular letters&#x2014;for the most part from poets, journalists, clergymen, editors, and clubmen who actually knew Mark Twain&#x2014;is that they were part of an elaborate April Fool joke devised by novelist George Washington Cable.<note type="an" xml:id="an001" place="foot" n="1">Mark Twain, himself, was notorious for reportorial hoaxes in the <hi rend="italic">Virginia City Territorial Enterprise</hi>, e.g. &#x201C;The Petrified Man,&#x201D; (4 October 1862), and &#x201C;A Bloody Massacre Near Carson,&#x201D; (28 October 1863). See the headnotes to these pieces in <hi rend="italic">ET&amp;S1</hi> for details.</note> This edition provides transcriptions and facsimiles of all of the letters known to survive, and the interview with Mark Twain published after the event in the New York <ref type="crossref" xml:id="cr003" target="sun.html"><hi rend="italic">Sun,</hi></ref> which serves as an interface, through its hyperlinked cross-references, to each letter it mentions. We have also provided a graph that explores the social and epistolary networks behind the joke.</p>
		<p rend="text-indent:2">The friendship of Samuel Clemens and George Washington Cable began at a luncheon in the home of Charles Dudley Warner in June 1881, for which the Clemenses were summoned by telegram from their vacation on the Long Island Sound to meet the charming Southern writer. Cable made fast friends, in every sense of the term, wherever he traveled that summer among the New York and Boston literati,<note type="an" xml:id="an003" place="foot" n="3">See Arlin Turner, <hi rend="italic">George W. Cable. A Biography,</hi> Durham: Duke University Press, 1956, supplemented by Cables's daughter's memoir of her father, <hi rend="italic">George W. Cable, His Life and Letters,</hi> New York and London: Charles Scribne's Sons, 1928).</note> and his immediate connection with the Clemenses was no exception, as he reported to his wife in a letter on 14 June:</p>
		<quote rend="blockquote"><p>And so I met Mark Twain. We all lunched together &amp; &#x201C;Mark&#x201D; &amp; Mr. Warner were ever so funny. But soon the Clemenses had to bid us good-bye &amp; return to the cars &amp; to New Haven. I will tell you all about it some day, from the hearty meeting to the pleasant but regretful parting.</p></quote>
<p rend="noindent">In 1882 their friendship was cemented in New Orleans, where Clemens and his publisher, James Osgood, had traveled as part of Clemens's return to the Mississippi for the purpose of writing a travel book, enlarging on the sketches in &#x201C;Old Times on the Mississippi,&#x201D; serialized in The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> in 1875, and reprinted in unauthorized book versions in London and Canada.</p>  
	<p rend="text-indent:2">When Cable decided to seek a new source of income in platform reading, the Hartford circle was instrumental in bolstering his confidence. Mark Twain himself puffed Cable in the Hartford <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>, and collected a dais full of supporters&#x2014;James Osgood, from Boston; Richard Watson Gilder, from New York; George E, Waring, Jr., from Newport; and Charles Dudley Warner&#x2014;to join him sitting behind Cable on the stage at Unity Hall, Hartford on 4 April 1883. From Hartford, Gilder and his <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi> colleagues whisked Cable off to New York for voice training under elocutionist and drama coach Franklin H. Sargent, pending his New York debut at the Madison Square Theater on 23 April. In the early winter of 1883 Cable engaged James Pond as his lecture manager, and launched a reading tour that took him through Springfield to Boston, where he was lionized by the likes of Whittier and Holmes. His Springfield <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi> reviewer, who may have been literary critic Charles G. Whiting, pronounced him &#x201C;doubly a genius&#x201D; in his combination of conception and execution, reminiscent of Dickens (&#x201C;Mr Cable's Reading Last Night,&#x201D; Springfield <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi>, 22 November 1883, 4). Later in 1884 and into 1885, Clemens and Cable would tour together under the management of James Pond<note type="an" xml:id="an002" place="foot" n="2">The misnomer &#x201C;Twins of Genius Tour&#x201D; has been applied to the slate of Cable-Clemens platform readings, misplacing Pond's epithet for a later pair of humorists under his management: Bill Nye and James Whitcomb Riley. See Benjamin Griffin, <ref target="http://www.twainquotes.com/TwinsOfGeniusNot.html" xml:id="cr001" type="crossref">&#x201C;Twins of Genius&#x2014;Not,&#x201D;</ref> on the Twainquotes website.</note>.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Cable's own tour included a reading in Hartford on 26 December 1883. On that occasion Cable had meant to be a one-night guest of the Clemenses, but a sudden case of the mumps held him in Hartford for nearly three weeks. During this time Cable witnessed first-hand his friend’s irritation with autograph requests:</p>
	<quote rend="blockquote"><p>I used to open our budget of letters together at breakfast. We had a good many. Nearly every morning Mark would sing out, &#x201C;By George, here’s an autograph hunter,&#x201D; and a moment later I would echo his remark as I found a correspondent asking for my sign manual” ("Cable's Autograph Joke," Buffalo <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, 10 April 1884).</p></quote> 
	<p rend="noindent">A month later he conceived this practical joke: he would arrange for bushels of autograph requests to pour in upon Clemens all arriving on April Fools' Day.  As Cable relates in that interview, he mentioned the idea to Robert Underwood Johnson of the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, Henry Ward Beecher, “who love[d] a practical joke better than his dinner,” and his lecture manager James Pond. By around 26 March the three had goaded him into taking action. While on a tour stop in Chicago, Cable had 150 circulars printed that he sent singly and in batches to several of his and Clemens’s mutual friends and acquaintances, primarily in Hartford, Boston, New York City, Brooklyn, Washington D.C., and Springfield.<note type="an" xml:id="an0004" place="foot" n="4">The size of the cache grew to 250 in the newspaper accounts.</note> As reported by Albert Bigelow Paine, Clemens's official biographer, </p><quote rend="blockquote"><p>On the morning of April 1st a stupefying mass of letters was unloaded on Mark Twain’s table. He did not know what to make of it, and Mrs. Clemens stood off to watch the results.</p></quote>
	<p rend="noindent">He then opened arguably the funniest letter in the bunch, from Dean Sage, and, again to quote Paine,</p> <quote rend="blockquote"><p>It amused and rather surprised him, and it fooled him completely; but when he picked up a letter from Brander Matthews, asking, in some absurd fashion, for his signature,</p></quote> <p rend="noindent">and then the absurd requests by many others,</p><quote rend="blockquote"><p>the size and quality of the joke began to overawe him. He was delighted, of course; for really it was a fine compliment, in its way, and most of the letters were distinctly amusing.</p></quote>
	<p>Clemens recalled this incident some years later, in a 19 June 1895 letter to the Scottish geologist and autograph collector John Horne:</p>
	<quote rend="blockquote"><p>“I once made a valuable collection of autograph letters myself—without knowing I was doing it. This was twelve or fifteen years ago. While we were at breakfast the 1st day of April (note that date), the mail—an extravagantly big one—was brought in. I opened letter after letter—from Holmes, Whittier, Lowell, Beecher, &amp; fifty-two others, celebrated, semi-celebrated, hemidemisemicelebrated, &amp; obscure—&amp; they all sang the same tune: a hungry and frantic supplication for my autograph! The first two or three astonished me, stupefied me; but after that I remembered what day of the year it was. George W. Cable got up that elaborate April Fool. He wrote some of those people, &amp; visited the rest, &amp; got them to write those letters to me. He did me a valuable favor. It will be long before I part with those autographs” (UCCL 04894, MS in ViU).<note type="an" xml:id="an005" place="foot" n="5">Two points jump out from this reminiscence: first, the number of applicants, curtailed from around 250 (as reported in the newspapers at the time), to 56, and second, the inclusion of autograph applications from Boston brahmins Holmes, Whittier, and Lowell, which are not extant, and may not have been written, according to Cable in the interview published on 10 April.In the New York <hi rend="italic">World</hi> account of the interview, Cable explicitly names &#x201C;Holmes and a lot of Boston fellows&#x201D; who were not in on the joke because Osgood, who was charged with disseminating circulars to them, was indisposed. ("The Joke on Mark Twain," New York <hi rend="italic">World</hi>, 10 April 1884, 8).</note></p></quote>

	<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens immediately seized upon this hoax as an opportunity for publicity—one of many self-marketing ploys that he would wield in collusion with the press throughout his life.<note type="an" xml:id="an0006" place="foot" n="6">See Louis J. Budd, <hi rend="italic">Our Mark Twain,</hi> Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1983, especially Chapter 6, &#x201C;Working the Newspapers.&#x201D;).</note> In preparation for a public presentation of the joke Clemens docketed the envelopes, usually with &#x201C;Good,&#x201D; &#x201C;No good,&#x201D; &#x201C;Mention.&#x201D; By 3 April a New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> representative and Clemens were poring over the letters together using Clemens's and the reporter's criteria for selection.<note type="an" xml:id="an007" place="foot" n="7">Letters that Clemens docketed "No good" were still mentioned in the interview if the sender was celebrated enough.</note> The <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> printed on 4 April the farcical interview, in which Clemens was given the opportunity to deliver several punch-lines about the cache of autograph applications, and ultimately to make himself the butt of the joke. Or did the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> make him the butt of their joke, as they had in several other instances in the 1870s and 80s? The interview may well have been written (with input from Clemens) primarily by <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> reporter Edward P. Mitchell, who took credit for another spurious interview with Mark Twain in the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> in 1881.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">At least two other reporters from the Boston <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and the Hartford <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> clearly had direct access to the letters on the same day that the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> correspondent saw them, and provided expanded treatment of them. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> account (dated 3 April) differs in a few substantive ways from the article in the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>.  The interview format is not entirely thrown over; at one point Clemens states: “You want to know … I'll show you.” But the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interviewer's report is not reprinted. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> reporter has his own embellishments to the tale, emphasizing Clemens's anger with Cable, and suggesting that Clemens considered calling out Cable to fight a duel. In the same vein Clemens was said to be considering taking revenge on the conspirators by printing their letters in a pamphlet to bring ridicule upon them.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">The list of letters is longer in both the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> versions; whereas Clemens primly kept ladies in private life out of the joke in the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview, many of them are included in the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> versions. Both the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> articles include two letters that are otherwise lost, one wanting Clemens's autograph for a cornerstone, and one saluting Clemens as the author of the controversial, anonymously published sensation, <hi rend="italic">The Bread-Winners</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> article also mentions a letter from A. W. Drake, art editor of the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, which has not been found, and one from J. R. Osgood, who did not participate in the joke, according to Cable in a later interview. The Hartford <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> article, with no dateline, but published on 4 April along with the other two, eschews the interview format altogether, and reports a few more letters than did the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, including an authentic request from Delia Young, which could be identified by the fact that she had had the courtesy to enclose a stamped envelope.</p>

	<p rend="text-indent:2"> Many of the participants in the joke have been named in the narrative above. The letters came from prominent people, though not from names a modern collector might consider first-rate autographs, because many of them have since become obscure. One of the purposes of this edition is to bring them, and the various social networks to which they belonged, back to life, as they relate to Clemens' social circle at a time when he was putting the finishing touches on his masterpiece&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</hi>. <note type="an" xml:id="an008" place="foot" n="8">He was at this time also sowing the seeds of a period of deep decline, in his literary work and his financial affairs. The failure of collaborators William Dean Howells and Clemens to secure John T. Raymond, the star of the first dramatic adaptation of Clemens and Warner's <hi rend="italic">Gilded Age</hi> novel, for a sequel, led Clemens to turn his attentions, unsuccessfully, to a dramatic adaptaton of <hi rend="italic">Tom Sawyer</hi>. Osgood's failure to successfully market <hi rend="italic">Life on the Mississippi</hi> (1882) due to his lack of infrastructure for subscription publishing led Clemens in 1885 to decide to enter into a doomed partnership with his nephew Charles L. Webster, initially to publish <hi rend="italic">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</hi>. Clemens had already heavily invested in the Paige type-setter, which would, along with the publishing house, eventually bankrupt him. </note></p>

<head>&#x201C;One of Mankind's Bores&#x201D;</head>
	<p> Unlike many of his contemporaries, Clemens did not commit his private papers and unpublished work to the stove, with one notable exception; a cache of letters to his mother Jane Lampton Clemens was burnt at his instruction after the death of his sister-in-law, Mollie Clemens (&#x201C;Letters of Twain Burned At His Wish,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, 15 December 1935). He was, in fact, a hoarder of unpublished manuscripts, grocery receipts, clippings, signed menus, but most importantly, for the literary historian, of letters. Clemens was a prodigious correspondent. The Mark Twain Project at the University of California at Berkeley has catalogued over <ref type="crossref" xml:id="cr005" target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/search?text=%22Clemens%2C+Samuel+L.%22&amp;text-join=&amp;field1=addressee&amp;category=letters&amp;style=mtp&amp;brand=mtp&amp;sort=date">12,000 letters addressed to Clemens</ref> and <ref type="crossref" xml:id="cr007" target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/search?text=%22Clemens%2C+Samuel+L.%22&amp;text-join=&amp;field1=writer&amp;category=letters&amp;style=mtp&amp;brand=mtp&amp;sort=date">11,000 letters written by him</ref>. New letters turn up almost weekly in auction catalogues, or as new finding aids become available online, or from searches in now digitized newspaper archives. Some rudimentary analysis of the nature of this public and private correspondence is possible using the faceting functionality of the <hi rend="italic">Mark Twain Project Online</hi> (MTPO) interface, which provides a letter count for each correspondent. For some correspondents there are voluminous batches, and for many there are smaller clutches of letters, but the largest category of all consists of a single letter or a single exchange of letters. These are overwhelmingly the sorts of letters from strangers&#x2014;fan letters, what he would call "begging" letters, autograph requests&#x2014;that Clemens labeled &#x201C;One of Mankind's Bores&#x201D; in a squib published in 1871.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens’ opinion of correspondence from his fans evolved in a predictable arc from welcome flattery, initially, to a daily nuisance. Once his reputation was established, as early as the 1870s, the demands of his correspondence were such that he was forced to divide  the year between the social and epistolary demands of Hartford for most of the time, and summers in Elmira where he could focus upon his literary work. As he described his predicament to his friend Mary Mason Fairbanks: &#x201C;My correspondence grew upon me to such an extent that it stopped [all of my] labor, nearly, &amp; so [was] destructive to our bread &amp; butter&#x201D; (SLC to MMF 13 Feb 1876).<note type="an" xml:id="an009" place="foot" n="9">He was less civil to his brother, Orion: &#x201C;My entire day has gone to the devil with answering letters—so it seemed a happy thought to imagine you to be the inventor of letter-writing &amp; letter-answering, &amp; soothe my soul by abusing you for it. But I see that the idea was absurd, for that would add to the day’s burden another letter&#x201D; (SLC to OC, 15 Oct 1881).</note> By 1878 these epistolary demands drove Clemens to seek a refuge abroad in order to write. In another letter to Mary Mason Fairbanks (23 December 1879), Clemens explained his ambivalence towards and irritation with the business of answering correspondence, suggesting that the primary purpose of his 1877&#x2013;78 trip to Europe was to escape “inane and brain-softening letter-writing.” And yet, “[t]hese letters are compliments, consequently one cannot disrespect them.” In speaking of compliments Clemens was most likley referring to a subset of his correspondence, which he sometimes docketed &#x201C;Appreciation,&#x201D; letters that appeared to have no purpose other than to express thanks or praise.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">In the midst of this mixed blessing Clemens did at least find fodder for an essay on his growing collection of private correspondence, and had plans (that did not come to fruition) for at least one other publication centering on the influx of requests from fans.<note type="an" xml:id="an010" place="foot" n="10">The Boston <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> account of the April Fool joke suggested that Clemens planned to take revenge on his hoaxers by printing their letters in a pamphlet, to expose them as fools themselves. Notorious autograph collector Edward Bok's pamphlet of autographs, including an early one by Clemens, was in the news in the spring of 1884, and may have served as inspiration for this idea.</note> In two early essays in the <hi rend="italic">Galaxy</hi>, of which he was the editor of the Memoranda column,  he expressed his frustration with letter-writing in “One of Mankind's Bores,” <hi rend="italic">Galaxy</hi> (February 1871). It begins:</p> 
		<quote rend="blockquote"><p>I suppose if there is one thing in the world more hateful than another to all of us, it is to have to write a letter. A private letter especially. And business letters, to my thinking, are very little pleasanter. Nearly all the enjoyment is taken out of every letter I get by the reflection that it must be answered. And I do so dread the affliction of writing those answers, that often my first and gladdest impulse is to burn my mail before it is opened ... I generally read them at breakfast, and right often they kill a day's work by diverting my thoughts and fancies into some new channel, thus breaking up and making confusion of the programme of scribbling I had arranged for my working hours.</p></quote>
		<p>There follows a comic catalog of irritating letters from strangers, such as the man who wrote asking whether domestic or foreign brads were better, or the Kentucky boy who offered to send his pet wildcat. This letter Clemens did answer, he admits, suggesting that the young man send it along to future April Fool letter-writer Henry Ward Beecher instead.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">In the 1870s Clemens considered compiling a pamphlet of his most exasperating begging letters. To his delight he found a fellow connoisseur and collector of begging letters in P. T. Barnum.  (Barnum to SLC 31 July 1874 (CU-MARK); 17 Sep 1875 to DeQuille); but, ironically their pact to continue to exchange “curious letters,” involved a shameless begging letter from Barnum, himself, who admitted that he had a &#x201C;small axe or hatchet to grind&#x201D; (Barnum to SLC, <ref type="crossref" xml:id="cr004" target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/view?docId=letters/UCCL01188.xml;query=Barnum%20axe;searchAll=;style=letter;brand=mtp#1">19 January 1875)</ref>: he hoped that Clemens could write clever advertising copy for his Hippodrome. Their friendship, such as it was, cooled soon thereafter.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">The main trope of the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview is Clemens's alleged concern that the April Fool letters were nothing more than axe-grinding letters, that is, letters with an ulterior motive cloaked in flattery, a typical form of begging letter. The importunities of friends like Barnum or of strangers grated on Clemens throughout his career. In a long annotation to a begging letter from a young author who had asked Clemens to read, and, most likely, comment upon, a book he was about to send, Clemens wrote: <quote rend="blockquote"><p>As I have remarked before about one thousand times the  coat of arms  of the human race ought to consist of a man with an ax on his shoulder proceeding toward a grindstone, or it ought to represent the several members of the human race holding out the hat to one another; for we are all beggars, each in his own way. One beggar is too proud to beg for pennies, but will beg for an introduction into society; another does not care for society, but he wants a postmastership; another will inveigle a lawyer into conversation and then sponge on him for free advice. The man who wouldn't do any of these things will beg for the Presidency. Each admires his own dignity and greatly guards it, but in his opinion the others haven't any.</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">... There is no man so poor but what at intervals some man comes to him with an ax to grind. By and by the ax's aspect becomes familiar to the proprietor of the grindstone. He perceives that it is the same old ax. If you are a governor you know that the stranger wants an office. The first time he arrives you are deceived; he pours out such noble praises of you and your political record that you are moved to tears; there's a lump in your throat and you are thankful that you have lived for this happiness. Then the stranger discloses his ax, and you are ashamed of yourself and your race. Six repetitions will cure you. After that you interrupt the compliments and say, &#x201C;Yes, yes, that's all right; never mind about that. What is it you want?&#x201D;</p>
		<p rend="text-imdent:2">But you and I are in the business ourselves. Every now and then we carry our ax to somebody and ask a whet. I don't carry mine to strangers&#x2014;I draw the line there; perhaps that is your way. This is bound to set us up on a high and holy pinnacle and make us look down in cold rebuke on persons who carry their axes to strangers.("Reflections on a Letter and a Book," MS at CU-MARK; published in Paine, <hi rend="italic">MTB</hi>, 1421&#x2013;22)</p></quote>

	<p rend="text-indent:2">Fiends, hunters, hounds, “the mosquitoes of literature,”<note type="an" xml:id="an0011" place="foot" n="11">So Washington Irving designated them in a letter published 14 June 1855  to L. Gaylord Clarke, editor of the Knickerbocker, </note> or “the celebritie’s [sic] bore,” as Pond described them, the hobbyist autograph seeker was universally despised by self-described true collectors and celebrities alike. The distinction between “true” and “false” collecting was made early on. Writers on collecting draw a clear bifurcation between collectors of historical evidence and amateurs for whom an autograph might be be an obsession, a relic, or purely an investment.<note type="an" xml:id="an012" place="foot" n="12">For an attempt to delineate a taxonomy of collectors see “The Collector,” <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi> 22 November 1851, 556: For some, autograph collecting might be a natural cousin to collecting geological specimens, butterflies, or shells. For others an autograph takes on the charismatic value of a relic, such as a handful of dirt from a battlefield, a pottery shard from the Acropolis, or the nose of a recumbent knight on his tomb.</note> Another mark or badge of the true collector is the claim to have built a collection without buying autographs on the market. One of the earliest successful American autograph collectors, Israel K. Tefft, of Savannah, succeeded in forming his large compilation without incurring any direct expense. One of his methods for achieving this was to ask for two autographs, so that he could barter one, having: &#x201C;always on hand duplicates of considerable worth, by the exchange of which he has been enabled to confer so peculiar a value and extend on his collection.” (“A Day Among the Autographs, Part I,” <hi rend="italic">Southern Rose Bud</hi>, April 18, 1835).</p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">The origin of autograph albums has been traced to the practice of itinerant students primarily from Germany and the Low Countries in the 16th and 17th centuries, who carried a blank book labeled variously an <hi rend="italic">album</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hortus</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">thesaurus amicorum</hi>, in which to record the signatures of acquaintances, professors, and eminent persons encountered in foreign cities.<note type="an" xml:id="an0013" place="foot" n="13">For a complete list of 859 known <ab rend="italic">Alba Amicorum</ab> in Dutch Libraries, see K.

They have been recognized as an early precursor to modern social networking media such as Facebook or LinkedIn. Originally the entries consisted of a motto or sentiment, often in the form of a quotation from Greek, Latin, or Hebrew, perhaps a piece of moral advice, inscribed over the writer's signature, and dated. By the later 16th and early 17th centuries, however, album entries often included coats of arms and elaborate watercolor emblems. The British Library owns some 600 of these albums, the oldest of which (MS Sloan 651, dated 1578) belonged to a woman. The album of Christophus Arnold of Nuremberg now held in the British Library (BM Egerton MS 1324, 85v) contains John Milton's autograph appended to a sentence in Greek, dated 19 November 1651.<note type="an" xml:id="an0014" place="foot" n="14">Rosenheim identified some 400 in the British Museum, primarily of German provenance. Gratz 10 counted 600. </note></p>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Other theories on the origins of autograph albums trace them to two types of household books. Simon Gratz, in <hi rend="italic">A Book About Autographs</hi>, credits´a certain Bohemian squire in the first decade of the 16th century who kept a diary of his hunting expeditions, which included signatures of his comrades of the chase (17). For the other type of household book, we return to Milton, one of the most sought-after celebrities of the early modern period, this time not approached by German travelers, but while traveling to Switzerland in 1639. On 10 June 1639 Milton inscribed two lines from his <hi rend="italic">Maske</hi> and a latin verse  from Horace in the visitors' book of his host Camillus Cardoyn, a Neapolitan  residing in Geneva. In all of these cases the signature documented a direct connection or association between a host and a guest, or between social peers. The practice became degraded and despised when albums, or pages of albums, were sent by mail to strangers, often for pecuniary gain, or to win false prestige.</p>

	<p rend="text-indent:2">As a literary, and increasingly as a cultural, celebrity, Clemens was thrust into the demands of association with other celebrities&#x2014;exchanges of books, most happily, or photographs; inscriptions in presidents' wives autograph albums; reciprocal praise of works in letters that could be mined for advertising copy, and so on. From all evidence Clemens was a somewhat tepid collector himself of autographs, and actively procured them primarily for his wife and daughters. At the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview on 3 April, and later, in his letter to Horne, mentioned above, Clemens spoke proudly of the autograph collection that had befallen him without effort on his part. Through his massive network of correspondence he was willy-nilly a collector of the purest sort.<note type="an" xml:id="an0015" place="foot" n="15">April Fool letter-writer Laurence Hutton, in his <hi rend="italic">Talks in a Library</hi> (1905), divided autograph hunters into four categories: Buyers, Beggars, Stealers, and Receivers (289).</note> An aggregate of extant known letters to Clemens contains autographs from presidents, actors, royalty, generals, statesmen, and nearly every literary light of his age (with some surprising exceptions: e.g. Frank Stockton, Jack London).</p>

	<p rend="text-indent:2">In the first extant response by Clemens to an autograph application from a stranger, sent to Malcolm Townsend (22 Apr 1867),<note type="an" xml:id="an0016" place="foot" n="16">Townsend does not appear in the Membership list compiled by Noyes L. Thompson (<hi rend="italic">The history of Plymouth Church: (Henry Ward Beecher) 1847-1872,</hi> New York, Carleton 1874) of the Plymouth Church of Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent group of participants in the 1884 joke.</note> Clemens gushes with evident embarrassment at having been asked to provide a sentiment. An examination of his early attempts at sentiment writing shows that the great writer of aphorisms had yet to develop his art. In a letter to Fannie Dennis (17 Feb 1871) he feigns absolute inexperience in writing a sentiment, and so borrows one: “that neat &amp; snappy thing which good old John Bunyan said to the Duke of Wellington: 'Give me liberty, or give me death!'”  The first note of pique we can find on autograph hunters comes in a letter to his wife Livy (31 Dec 1873). By 21 Oct 1882 in a letter to his sister Pamela he labels autograph collectors as an “infernal distress:”</p>
	<quote rend="blockquote"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">autographs are a more infernal distress to me than any other grievance or annoyance that falls to my lot. i have no patience with them whatever. anybody that makes such an application to me seems a nuisance. it is a silly practice. except in just such cases as you mention, the schroters, personal friends. but when one has been persecuted to the verge of lunacy by strangers, the mere suggestion of autographs is irritating, no matter whence it comes. </hi></p></quote>
	<p>Clemens clearly distinguished among categories of autograph requests; he was usually happy to discharge the duties of association: the exchange of books or photographs with his friends and peers. This category extended to railroad station agents, steamships’ crew, or friends of the family. When he approved of the application and the cause, he provided autographs to be sold for philanthropic purposes. As the value of his autograph grew Clemens sent many philanthropic samples to various benefits, fairs, schools, and hospitals. In principal he abhorred the market and the cheek of autograph fiends. However, depending on his mood, his schedule, the craft of the letter, or lack of ruse, a charming letter, especially from a young lady or a child, could induce him to reply. There were categories of ruses to gain his autograph that Clemens called &#x201C;too thin&#x201D;: letters asking him to lecture in far-flung towns; letters granting him honorary membership in Literary clubs; questions about characters or tales; requests for biographical information to be delivered to  parochial literary clubs of which he may or may not have been made an honorary member. Clemens ignored hundreds of requests throughout his career. There is direct evidence for this in the Mark Twain Papers, where the applicant’s stamped envelope is enclosed, unreturned. Clemens also docketed scores of autograph bids with “No answer” or just “No.”</p>

	<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens developed several clever techniques for foiling autograph fiends. By 1879 he  starting recruiting amanuenses to respond to requests for him:</p>
	<quote rend="blockquote"><p>Mrs. Clemens usually helps me beat ingenious autograph-hunters like the enclosed, but her hands are frightfully full, just now. Will you ask Winnie or John to write on the postal cards &amp; ship them. Let both be dated Boston  Hartford,  &amp; signed “S L Clemens—Per J. L. McWilliams.” I have written form of reply across the end of one of the cards &amp; at the bottom of the note-sheet.

<p rend="noindent">Notoriously quick to adopt new technologies, such as the telephone and the typewriter, and thereby the first American author to submit a typed literary MS to the printer, he found the typewriter an excellent tool for discouraging autograph hunters.</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p>I remember the first letter I dictated. It was to Edward Bok, who was a boy then.<note type="an" xml:id="an017" place="foot" n="17">Edward Bok (1863&#x2013;1930) was a Dutch-born American editor and author who first came to public notice as an intrepid collector of autographs. </note> I was not acquainted with him at that time. His present enterprising spirit is not new—he had it in that early day. He was accumulating autographs, and was not content with mere signatures, he wanted a whole autograph letter. I furnished it—in type-machine capitals, signature and all. It was long; it was a sermon; it contained advice; also reproaches. I said writing was my trade, my bread and butter; I said it was not fair to ask a man to give away samples of his trade; would he ask the blacksmith for a horseshoe? would he ask the doctor for a corpse? (“From My Unpublished Autobiography,” <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Weekly</hi> 18 Mar 1905, 391).</p></quote>
	<p rend="text=indent:2">In 1880 Clemens had printed facsimiles of holographic correspondence cards made to send to the flood of applicants for lecture engagements, stating that he had <ref type="crossref" xml:id="cr002" target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/UCCL01062.xml;query=%22quitted%20the%20platform%22;doc.view=facsimile;style=letter;brand=mtp#1">“quitted the platform permanently.”</ref><note type="an" xml:id="an0018" place="foot" n="18">Requests of this sort were known to be a ruse of autograph hunters.

D. C. <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi>, 11 Dec 1850, n.p.). </note>  Later that year he had his nephew and business associate Charles Webster order 300 more (SLC to Webster,  27 Oct 1881). Around the same time Clemens discovered another opportunity for substituting a printed text for the desired holograph, when Howells suggested he print up a biography to send to the flood of fans and journalists pressing him for one:</p>
		<quote rend="blockquote"><p>The idea of that printed biography is a noble good one: saves me time, rage, excuses, declinations, disgust, humiliation; &amp; from frenzies of blasphemy which exhaust me physically as well as morally; &amp; besides, it at the same time it furnishes  to  the inquiring idiot connected with the literary society exactly what he has asked for, &amp; softly &amp; neatly chouses him out of the thing he was really after, viz., a humorous  autograph  letter which would  make  him the most important ass connected with the Society for one whole evening. You may use that idea—no charge (SLC to Howells, 19 Oct 1880).</p></quote>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Samuel L. Clemens has been labeled an American cultural icon of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His life took him from a printing shop in Hannibal with dreams of coca trading in South America to riverboat piloting, followed by two weeks in a rag-tag Missouri militia at the outbreak of the Civil War, to a slew of far western adventures, as assistant to his brother Orion, the Secretary of Nevada territory, to pocket mining, journalism, and finally publication in Eastern newspapers and magazines, followed by success as an author, and a storybook  marriage into a wealthy upstate New York abolitionist family: all these picaresque experiences set the foundation for the future mugwump, creator of <hi rend="italic">Huck Finn</hi>, and political agitator against imperialism. His intrepid life was full of networking and correspondence. The Mark Twain Papers and Project holds 32,000 letters (incoming and outgoing) in manuscript, transcript, and facsimile&#x2014;a remarkable cache, and a veritable nineteenth-century Republic of Letters.</p>
</div2>

	<div2><head>Social and Epistolary Networks</head>
		<p>In 2009 the Stanford-based <hi rend="italic">Mapping the Republic of Letters</hi> project released its truly sensational graph visualization application built to explore social networking in the Enlightenment through correspondence, and thereby set a high bar for future digital humanities projects working with correspondence metadata. Correspondence also plays an important part in the Social Network and Archival Contexts (SNAC) project, which uses EAC-CPF metadata extracted from EAD finding aids to build a linked data set that underlies an elaborate search interface complete with a radial graph visualization of a given entity's networked relationships. Althought the TEI offers a linkRelation element that can express relationships within a document or a corpus sharing a common personography file, as this edition does, the integration of TEI with EAD-CPF, with its richer possibilities for linked data applications, is a likely direction for future projects bringing the TEI into the arena of linked social network applications. <note type="an" xml:id="an019" place="foot" n="19">See, for intance, Fabio Ciotti et al, &#x201C;TEI, Ontologies, Linked Open Data: Geolat and Beyond,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Text Encoding initiative</hi> [Online], Issue 8, December 2014&#x2013;December 2015.</note></p>
		
			<p rend="text-indent:2">The primary network documented in this edition expresses itself in hyperlinking between a  transcription of the Mark Twain interview that appeared in the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> on 4 April, and the letters Mark Twain mentioned in it, with their own cross-references to other letters both within the edition and out to letters and resources on marktwainproject.org. The method of letter selection started with Clemens's hasty reading and docketing of the pile of applications ("as tall as a silk hat"), followed no doubt by some discussion with the interviewer. There are direct and indirect references to fifty-five of the extant letters, which  are &#x201C;networked&#x201D; from that interface. The entire list of letter transcriptions is accessible using another interface offering a hyperlinked table of letters.</p>
			
		<p rend="text-indent:2">Two small-scale, unlinked, network tools accompany this edition: the first is a simple TEI listRelation keyed to the personography, and the second comprises PDF and sigma-js exports of a network graph composed in a Gephi client using source, target and edge label triples derived from a simple entity-relationship database in Access. The database consists of three tables: entity (personal or corporate), relationshipType (link label), and relationshipLink, to provide, with a self-join on entity, the three fields of the triple. Relationships are rendered in both directions, e.g.  x is a member of y club; y club has x, z, a, and b as members, to allow for richer network exploration through directed links. Two sets of data inform these graphed relationships: the recipients of the circulars, and the recipients' social circles (including family, neighborhood, employment, friendship, or club relationships).</p>
			
			<p rend="text-indent:2">The graph visualizations show several heavily visited nodes of association: 1) the members of the closely related Authors and Fencers Clubs, and American Copyright League, centered around the Gilder household, which was also the site of a very popular Friday evening “At Home” salon; 2) the Brooklyn Plymouth Church circle of Henry Ward Beecher, with a subset of the 1867 <hi rend="italic">Quaker City</hi> passengers to the Holy Land; 3) the Lotos Club (of which Clemens was a member); 4) Clemens's Hartford neighbors; 5) several family units: the Ponds, the Warings, the Beaches, Stedmans, along with several husband-wife pairs; 5) the Kinsmen Club and Tile Club artist circles; 6) the <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi>; 7) the Boston circle of Thomas Bailey Aldrich.<note type="an" xml:id="an020" place="foot" n="20">The full set of relationships traced in the database is as follows: LIST HERE.</note> Two letter writers remain unidentified: H. Robinson, and D. G. MacNeill; the former had a direct relationship with the Gilder circle since he or she writes from the address of The Studio. But the latter, a clerk in a Insulated Cable manufacturing company, is a true outlier in the network.</p>
		
			<div3><head>The Documents: What Do we Have? What's Missing?</head>
		<p rend="noindent">The circulars printed by Cable were intended to be disseminated to friends of Clemens from the literary and journalistic guilds, with none going to strangers or to minors. Given the inherently random method of dissemination, copies did end up in the hands of strangers to Clemens (Macneill, Jenkins, Hyatt Smith), or very distant acquaintances (Scudder), or indeed friends of friends and relatives of friends. It should come as no surprise that the recipient list was perhaps more heavily weighted towards Cable's circle, although Clemens claims in the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview that about two-thirds of the letters came from his own personal friends. An examination of Cable's letters and various newspaper accounts of his Northern platform successes from 1882&#x2013;84 provides the names of several of the letter writers in this edition. Which letters are extant? which are not? which may be fictions? For the joke, as it played out and was represented in the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview, involved a certain amount of fabrication if only to make the interviewer's own storyline succeed.</p> 
		
				<p rend="text-indent:2">There are 79 known April Fool letters extant&#x2014;77 at the Mark Twain Papers in Berkeley, one at Vassar, and one at the Huntington Library. Circulars from Cable are held by New York Public Library (addressed to Warner), the University of Dayton (addressed to Violet Beach), and the Hartford House (to E. C. Stedman). In addition, a letter from H. C. Bunner to his future brother-in-law Walter Learned implies that he had also received a circular from Cable. Several clues exist both in the letters and in the 10 April Cable interview as to how some of the circulars were disseminated. Cable appended a note to the stack he sent to Charles Dudley Warner in Hartford, instructing him to distribute them among the “Monday [Evening] Club” there. remarking that the only other direct recipients of the circular in Hartford were Lilly Warner and Joseph Twichell. Letters from these two neighbors and friends of Clemens are not extant. An entry in Twichell’s notebook gives the impression that he interpreted a line in the circular to read that this was a joke intended for Clemens's literary friends (MS at Yale). Another circular that appears to have elicited no direct response was the one Cable sent to Violet Beach, daughter of Moses Sperry Beach. Her father and brother did write letters, however. A handful of letters mentioned in the newspaper accounts have not been found: a telegram from American Exchange manager Henry F. Gillig, a letter from a General Blodgett, and a letter from illustrator A. W. Drake of the <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi>. The Boston <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> and Hartford <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> articles listed two anonymous letters (which are among the lost ones), one naming Clemens the author of <hi rend="italic">The Bread-Winners</hi>, the other asking for an autograph for a corner-stone. There are two cases where a correspondent allegedly sent two communications, according to the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview: a letter and a telegram, but in both cases these are likely fictions.<note type="an" xml:id="an021" place="foot" n="21">Richard Watson Gilder, in his letter of 6 April, mentions an earlier April Fool telegram that SLC had not answered, for which he was making amends by sending a letter with a (canceled, Persian) stamp enclosed.  And the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> interview mentions an earlier telegram from Thomas Knox asking for an unspecified number of autographs for the children of the King of Siam, that number supplied in the extant letter.</note> In the 10 April interview Cable reveals that because of a fateful packet of circulars sent to James Osgood, who, unknown to Cable, was away: “we were out on Dr. Holmes and a lot of Boston fellows.” No joke letter from Clemens's close friend William Dean Howells has turned up, though he and Clemens were at the time engaged in a serious correspondence about their inability to sign John T. Raymond to an amenable contract for the new <hi rend="italic">Col. Sellers</hi> play on which they were collaborating.</p></div3>
		<div3><head>Cable's Northern Social Circles</head>
			<p>Two of Cable's earliest Northern literary mentors were Richard Watson Gilder, editor of <hi rend="italic">Scribner's Magazine</hi>, and Hjalmar Boyesen, professor of Scandinavian Languages at Cornell, who were instrumental in bringing Cable's work into the Scribners' fold. The Gilder household, which extended to Helena de Kay Gilder's brother Charles de Kay, was the center of several important literary and artistic movements and clubs in the 1880s and 1890s. In a converted stable the Gilders called The Studio, organizing meetings took place for The Authors Club, the American Copyright League, and the Society of American Artists. Perhaps more importantly for the purposes of this essay, the Gilders' Friday night &#x201C;At Home&#x201D; salon was attended by the likes of Clara Louise Kellogg, Helena Modjeska, Robert Swain Gifford, Henry C. Bunner, Brander Matthews, and, when he was in town, George Washington Cable. Another important mentor was George E. Waring, Jr., of Newport and Washington, D.C., who, after reading Cable's <hi rend="italic">Creole Days</hi> (1879) en route to New Orleans in his capacity as Census statistician, called upon its author to help him write historical introductions to the statistical information to be gathered on cities in Louisiana. Waring negotiated a very generous 22.5% royalty settlement for Cable's <hi rend="italic">Dr. Sevier</hi> (1884) with his own publisher, James Osgood, much to the consternation of Scribner's Sons. Cable contracted with James Pond in December 1883 to manage the tour on which he contracted the mumps, and devised his April Fool joke. On extremely short notice Pond was able to book readings in Boston, with an intimate practice run in Springfield. According to his biographer, Cable was visited by April Fool letter writer Horace E. Scudder after one of his Boston performances (Turner, 148). In January 1884 Cable made the acquaintance of Henry Ward Beecher, who became  an instant friend and co-conspirator. Beecher was the hub of a wide circle of members of Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, and of the few letter writers who had been on the Church-sponsored <hi rend="italic">Quaker City</hi> excursion to the Holy Land with Clemens in 1867.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens's considerable social circle intersects with these networks at several points. He and Cable shared the same publisher (Osgood) and the same lecture manager (Pond). Boyesen and Waring were also close friends of Clemens since the 1870s. Although he doesn't appear to have frequented the Gilders's &#x210C;At Homes&#x201D;, Clemens was an early member of both the Authors Club and the American Copyright League. He was much sought after by the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> editors as a contributor, but had submitted only one essay in 1881. His Brooklyn connection with Beecher was of long standing, and filled with mutual ribbing (as in the wildcat joke above), and his association with the related Quaker City contingent of 1867 was often vexed. Clemens had been embroiled in a war of insults and lawsuits with the ship's captain Charles Duncan since 1877. The suit Duncan brought against Clemens and the New York <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which employed letter-writer Noah Brooks, had just been settled. </p>	
			<p rend="text-indent:2">Mark Twain, according to the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> reporter who interviewed him about the April Fool joke, was proud to be the owner of what he hoped would grow into a larger pile of joke letters (it never did), but according to the Boston <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> account, he threatened to expose the rascals behind the joke by publishing their letters in a pamphlet complete with ascerbic annotations and caricatures. We offer this annotated edition of Cable's circular-driven joke on Mark Twain as a basic example of how textual editions might be paired with biographical metadata in TEI and from a simple entity-relationship database to examine the importance of social networks in nineteenth-century literary and artistic circles.<note type="an" xml:id="an022" place="foot" n="22">The Lehigh <hi rend="italic">Vault at Pfaff's</hi> website traces networks among the mid-century bohemians who frequented that Rathskeller through references to one another in their letters and other private documents.

<div2>
	<head>Editorial Principles</head>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Given that this edition consists of private documents, we have aimed to reproduce the documents as exactly and fully as possible, and not to correct misspelled words and other errors, or to omit such things as cancellations and insertions made at the time of composition. This is especially important for the April Fool letters, a few of which Clemens actually changed in the process of &#x201C;preparing&#x201D; them either for a pamphlet or for his interviews. We have accounted for Clemens's changes in the contextual footnotes.</p>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">A corrected or polished letter would be misleading to a historian, since the value of letters as evidence arises from their having been created, sent, and received at a particular time and in a particular condition. The letter is a snapshot in time, and the wisest editorial course is to resist the temptation to “clean it up.” Therefore we employ a version of the &#x201C;plain text&#x201D; transcription method in use at the Mark Twain Project. It is designed to maximize the kinds and amount of manuscript detail that can be legibly and intelligibly included in typographical transcriptions, including as much detail while also making the text highly legible. Each insertion is surrounded by in-line carets, and deletions are left in the text with strikethroughs. All editorial commentaries are in-text, and italicized, within brackets.</p>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Plain text is a critical method of transcription, and purposely omits certain details that it could include, but only at the expense of legibility and without adequately increasing meaningful detail to offset that loss of legibility. For instance, most of the original lineation in a letter is the result of chance—where and how the words must be divided into lines to fit on the paper being used—and therefore cannot ordinarily have any meaning. If one were to reproduce letters line-for-line in type, all written on many different kinds and sizes of paper, the result would often be harder to read than the original. Where lineation is not random, but is deliberate, as in an address or in the opening lines of a letter, it is meaningful, and we do reproduce it. Some forms of typographical standardization were nevertheless required: letterheads, with thewir myriad forms, are in smallcaps; spaces for datelines, salutes, and signature lines have been approximated and spaced according to the standards of letter-writing during this period; and special features such as monograms have either been ignored or approximated depending on their reproducibility.</p>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">We have also chosen not to emend the copy texts of the letters and the article in the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>. The reason for transcribing the letters is fairly straightforward, given that the letters themselves do not present any noticeable ambiguities or puzzling errors. Errors made by the writer are not emended so long as they can be intelligibly transcribed. Some errors of omission may be corrected by editorial interpolation—that is, by supplying an intended but omitted character, word, or words within editorial square brackets, ‘thu[s]’ or ‘“thus[”]’—but only when we were confident that the writer has inadvertently omitted what we have supplied, or when relevant information from, say, a postmark, has been torn away. Interpolated corrections may be necessary to construe the text at all, let alone to read it easily, and would therefore be supplied by any reader if not supplied by the editor. As to the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> article, we would have emended the copy text if we had evidence that Clemens participated in the writing of the article, or wrote a letter that supplied information to be printed. But we have no evidence that the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> article (and the other April Fool letters) was anything more than an interview with some (probably creative) interpolations by the newspaper writer. It nonetheless begs the question about the status of an interview: while serving as a kind of communication, it is still neither &#x201C;work&#x201D; nor a &#x201C;private document.&#x201D; We cannot justifiably emend the copy text (except to correct misprints) because it was not written and authorized by Clemens, even though his words take center stage. Despite the temptation to treat this performance as a kind of work, it is best to treat it as a piece of documentary evidence, and to relate it to the private documents that form its subject. Again, the available evidence in the interview suggests not only some amusing comments from Clemens, but also that he engineered the public dispersal of the hoax.</p>
	
	<p rend="text-indent:2">We chose not to edit the notes on the envelopes that were determined by us (with the approval of Robert Hirst) to have not been written by Clemens. Most of these additional notes were written by Clemens's biographer Albert Bigelow Paine, and possibly by the early Mark Twain scholar and curator of the Mark Twain Papers, Bernard DeVoto.</p>
</div2><div2>
	<head>Encoding</head>
	<p rend="text-indent:2">The 2016 issue of the Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative demonstrated the need for standards in encoding correspondence with its &#x201C;Towards a Model for Encoding Correspondence in the TEI: Developing and Implementing &lt;correspDesc&gt;,&#x201D; by Peter Stadler, Marcel Illetschko, and Sabine Seifert. Our encoding decisions involved an adoption of the in-house standards developed for MTPO, and some of the lessons we have learned from Stadler et al's article in <hi rend="italic">jTEI</hi>. For example, the TEI ought to have an element for letterheads, so we have borrowed from MTP's customized letters schema to implement a &lt;letterhead&gt; element, as well as some mandatory attributes for &lt;pb&gt;s and &lt;note type="an" xml:id="an023" place="foot" n="23"&gt;s, for example. That is simple enough. Yet other curious elements in our set remain to be discussed as the TEI evolves and creates standards. Most of these issues involve the envelope, with its attendant attributes (postmarks, address lines, inscriptions on the envelopes). We departed from the MTP practice of including envelopes within a nested &lt;div2&gt; (and its parts within a &lt;div3&gt;), and instead treated the envelope as a sibling (rather than a child) of the letter in terms of xml hierarchy. This aligns our encoding more with the editors of the Digital Archive of Letters in Flanders (DALF), who justified their specialized correspondence editing quite effectively in &#x201C;Describing, Transcribing, Encoding, and Editing Modern Correspondence: A Textbase Approach,&#x201D; by Edward Vanhoutte and Ron Van den Branden. The parts of the envelope are currently within an &lt;ab&gt; with editorial notes in italics within brackets, though we are aware of the lack of elements that could probably mark up aspects of the envelope. </p>
		
	<p rend="text-indent:2">Our solution borrows from the way in which MTP edits envelope material, but this solution is limited, and necessary in the absence of TEI standards for such documents. One reason for this hesitation on our part is not just a result of the lack of standards, but we also believe that editors must decide on crucial ontological issues. Is a letterhead worthy of its own element? Is an envelope a sibling or a child of a letter text? Should any instance of address require a set of elements? For example, we have chosen to do separate &lt;div&gt; elements for the letter text and for its parts (mostly envelopes), even though we are aware, and acknowledge Vanhoutte and van den Branden's valid point that encoders ought to avoid using &lt;div&gt;s for anything other than real subdivisions. Our choice reflects our idea of a letter as a communicative private document that has many constituent (and equal) parts: for us, that includes the &#x201C;metadata&#x201D; (date, addresses, addressee, etc.), the main form of communication, enclosures, and an envelope. Yet the envelope material contained within a &#x201C;post-transmission&#x201D; &lt;div&gt; still keeps it separate from the letter proper, yet still part of the letter's &lt;body&gt;. In our case the envelope has forms of other communication, with Clemens's notes, secretary's notes, and notes by his biographer Albert Bigelow Paine taken down much later. The theoretical debate about the envelope's place in a letter is yet to be determined by the TEI, but for our part we side with the ideas of DALF and offer our encoding as another way to think of encoding correspondence.</p>
