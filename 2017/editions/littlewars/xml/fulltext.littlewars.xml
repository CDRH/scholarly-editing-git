                <head>OF THE LEGENDARY PAST</head>
                <p> “Little Wars” is the game of kings&#8212;for players in an inferior social
                    position. It can be played by boys of every age from twelve to one hundred and
                    fifty&#8212;and even later if the limbs remain sufficiently supple,&#8212;by
                    girls of the better sort, and by a few rare and gifted women. This is to be a
                    full History of Little Wars from its recorded and authenticated beginning until
                    the present time, an account of how to make little warfare, and hints of the
                    most priceless sort for the recumbent strategist. . . . </p>
                <p> But first let it be noted in passing <pb n="8" facs="wells-little-wars 0006.jpg"
                    /> that there were prehistoric “Little Wars.” This is no new thing, no crude
                    novelty; but a thing tested by time, ancient and ripe in its essentials for all
                    its perennial freshness&#8212;like spring. There was a Someone who fought Little
                    Wars in the days of Queen Anne; a garden Napoleon. His game was inaccurately
                    observed and insufficiently recorded by Laurence Sterne. It is clear that Uncle
                    Toby and Corporal Trim were playing Little Wars on a scale and with an
                    elaboration exceeding even the richness and beauty of the contemporary game.<ptr
                        target="#note1" xml:id="nr1" n="1"/> But the curtain is drawn back only to
                    tantalise us. It is scarcely conceivable that anywhere now on earth the Shandean
                    Rules remain on record. Perhaps they were never committed to paper. . . . </p>

                <pb n="9" facs="wells-little-wars 0007.jpg"/>
                <p> And in all ages a certain barbaric warfare has been waged with soldiers of tin
                    and lead and wood, with the weapons of the wild, with the catapult, the elastic
                    circular garter, the peashooter, the rubber ball, and suchlike
                    appliances&#8212;a mere setting up and knocking down of men. Tin murder. The
                    advance of civilisation has swept such rude contests altogether from the
                    playroom. We know them no more. . . . </p>

                <head>THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN LITTLE WARFARE</head>
                <p>The beginning of the game of Little War, as we know it, became possible with the
                    invention of the spring breechloader gun.<ptr target="#note2" xml:id="nr2" n="2"
                    /> This priceless gift to boyhood appeared somewhen towards the end of the last
                    century, a gun capable of hitting a toy soldier nine times out of ten at the
                    distance of nine yards. It has completely superseded all the spiral-spring and
                    other makes of gun hitherto used in playroom warfare. These spring breechloaders
                    are made in various sizes and patterns, but the one used in our game is that
                    known in <pb facs="wells-little-wars 0009.jpg"/>

                <p> It was with one of these guns that the beginning of our war game was made. It

                <p> The present writer had been lunching with a friend&#8212;let me veil his
                    identity under the initials J. K. J.<ptr target="#note5" xml:id="nr5" n="5"
                    />&#8212;in a room littered with the irrepressible debris of a small boy’s
                    pleasures. On a table near our own stood four or five soldiers and one of these
                    guns. Mr J. K. J., his more urgent needs satisfied and the coffee imminent, drew
                    a chair to this little table, sat down, examined the gun discreetly, loaded it
                    warily, aimed, and hit his man. Thereupon he boasted of <pb n="12"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0012.jpg"/> the deed, and issued challenges that
                    were accepted with avidity. . . </p>
                <p> He fired that day a shot that still echoes round the world.<ptr target="#note6"
                        xml:id="nr6" n="6"/> An affair&#8212;let us parallel the Cannonade of

                    shooting not very different in spirit&#8212;but how different in results
                    !&#8212;from the prehistoric warfare of catapult and garter. “But suppose,” said
                    his antagonists; “suppose somehow one could move the men !” and therewith opened
                    a new world of belligerence. </p>
                <p> The matter went no further with Mr J. K. J. The seed lay for a time gathering
                    strength, and then began to germinate with another friend, Mr W.<ptr
                        target="#note8" xml:id="nr8" n="8"/> To Mr W. was broached the idea: “I <pb
                        n="13" facs="wells-little-wars 0013.jpg"/> believe that if one set up a few
                    obstacles on the floor, volumes of the <emph rend="italic">British

                    soldiers and guns about, one could have rather a good game, a kind of <emph

                </p>
                <p> Primitive attempts to realise the dream were interrupted by a great rustle and
                    chattering of lady visitors. They regarded the objects upon the floor with the
                    empty disdain of their sex for all imaginative things. </p>
                <p> But the writer had in those days a very dear friends, a man too ill for long
                    excursions or vigorous sports [he has been dead now these six years],<ptr
                        target="#note10" xml:id="nr10" n="10"/> of a very sweet companionable
                    disposition, a hearty jester and full of the spirit of play. To him the idea was
                    broached more fruitfully. We got two forces of<pb n="14"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0014.jpg"/> toy soldiers, set out a lumpish
                    Encyclopædic land upon the carpet, and began to play. We arranged to move in
                    alternate moves: first one moved all his force and then the other; an
                    infantry-man could move one foot at each move, a cavalry-man two, a gun two, and
                    it might fire six shots; and if a man was moved up to touch another man, then we
                    tossed up and decided which man was dead. So we made a game, which was not a
                    good game, but which was very amusing once or twice. The men were packed under
                    the lee of fat volumes, while the guns, animated by a spirit of their own,
                    banged away at any exposed head, or prowled about in search of a shot.
                    Occasionally men came into contact, with remarkable results. Rash is the man who
                    trusts <pb n="15" facs="wells-little-wars 0015.jpg"/> his life to spin of a
                    coin. One impossible paladin slew in succession nine men and turned defeat to
                    victory, to the extreme exasperation of the strategist who had led those victims
                    to their doom. This inordinate factor of chance eliminated play; the individual
                    freedom of guns turned battles into scandals of crouching concealment; there was
                    too much cover afforded by the books and vast intervals of waiting while the
                    players took aim. And yet there was something about it. . . . It was a game
                    crying aloud for improvement. Improvement came almost simultaneously in several
                    directions. First there was the development of the Country. The soldiers did not
                    stand well on an ordinary carpet, the Encyclo- <pb n="16"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0016.jpg"/> pædia made clumsy cliff-like “cover,”
                    and more particularly the room in which the game had its beginnings was subject
                    to the invasion of callers, alien souls, trampling skirt-swishers, chatterers,
                    creatures unfavourably impressed by the spectacle of two middle-aged men playing
                    with “toy soldiers” on the floor, and very heated and excited about it. Overhead
                    was the day nursery, with a wide extent of smooth cork carpet (the natural
                    terrain of toy soldiers), a large box of bricks&#8212;such as I have described
                    in <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph>,<ptr target="#note11" xml:id="nr11"
                        n="11"/>&#8212;and certain large inch-thick boards. </p>
                <p>It was an easy task for the head of the household to evict his offspring, annex
                    these advantages, and set about planning a more realistic country. (I forget
                    what became of the children.)</p>

                <pb n="17" facs="wells-little-wars 0017.jpg"/>
                <p> The thick boards were piled up one upon another to form hills; holes were bored
                    in them, into which twigs of various shrubs were stuck to represent trees;
                    houses and sheds (solid and compact piles of from three to six or seven inches
                    high, and broad in proportion) and walls were made with the bricks; ponds and
                    swamps and rivers, with fords and so forth indicated, were chalked out on the
                    floor, garden stones were brought in to represent great rocks, and the “Country”
                    at least of our perfected war game was in existence. We discovered it was easy
                    to cut out and bend and gum together paper cardboard walls, into which our toy
                    bricks could be packed, and on which we could paint doors and windows,
                        creepers<ptr target="#note12" xml:id="nr12" n="12"/> and rain-water pipes,
                    and so forth, to repre- <fw>2</fw>
                    <pb n="18" facs="wells-little-wars 0018.jpg"/> sent houses, castles, and
                    churches in a more realistic manner, and, growing skilful, we made various
                    bridges and so forth of card. Every boy who has ever put together model villages
                    knows how to do these things, and the attentive reader will find them edifyingly
                    represented in our photographic illustrations. </p>
                <p>There has been little development since that time in the Country. Our
                    illustrations show the methods of arrangement, and the reader will see how
                    easily and readily the utmost variety of battlefields can be made. (It is merely
                    to be remarked that a too crowded Country makes the guns ineffective and leads
                    to a mere tree to tree and house to house scramble, and that large open spaces

                    cannonades, because of the danger of any advance. On the whole, too much cover
                    is better than too little.) We decided that one player should plan and lay out
                    the Country, and the other player choose from which side he would come. And
                    to-day we play over such landscapes in a cork-carpeted schoolroom, from which
                    the proper occupants are no longer evicted but remain to take an increasingly
                    responsible and less and less audible and distressing share in the operations. </p>
                <p>We found it necessary to make certain general rules. Houses and sheds must be
                    made of solid lumps of bricks, and not hollow so that soldiers can be put inside
                    them, because otherwise muddled situations arise. And it was clearly <pb n="20"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0022.jpg"/> necessary to provide for the replacement
                    of disturbed objects by chalking out the outlines of boards and houses upon the
                    floor or boards upon which they stood.</p>
                <p>And while we thus perfected the Country, we were also eliminating all sorts of
                    tediums, disputable possibilities, and deadlocks from the game. We decided that
                    every man should be as brave and skilful as every other man, and that when two
                    men of opposite sides came into contact they would inevitably kill each other.
                    This restored strategy to its predominance over chance. </p>

                        facs="wells-little-wars 0023.jpg"/> duced the number to four&#8212;men
                    within six inches of it. And we ruled that a gun could not both fire and move in
                    the same general move: it could either be fired or moved (or left alone). If
                    there were less than six men within six inches of a gun, then we tried letting
                    it fire as many shots as there were men, and we permitted a single man to move a
                    gun, and move with it as far as he could go by the rules&#8212;a foot, that is,
                    if he was an infantry-man, and two feet if he was a cavalry-man. We abolished
                    altogether that magical freedom of an unassisted gun to move two feet. And on
                    such rules as these we fought a number of battles. They were interesting, but
                    not entirely satisfactory. We took no prisoners&#8212;a feature at once barbaric
                    and unconvincing. The battles lingered on <pb n="22"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0024.jpg"/> a long time, because we shot with
                    extreme care and deliberation, and they were hard to bring to a decisive finish.
                    The guns were altogether too predominant. They prevented attacks getting home,
                    and they made it possible for a timid player to put all his soldiers out of
                    sight behind hills and houses, and bang away if his opponent showed as much as
                    the tip of a bayonet. Monsieur Bloch seemed vindicated, and Little War had
                    become impossible.<ptr target="#note14" xml:id="nr14" n="14"/> And there was
                    something a little absurd, too, in the spectacle of a solitary drummer-boy, for
                    example, marching off with a gun. </p>
                <p>But as there was nevertheless much that seemed to us extremely pretty and
                    picturesque about the game, we set to work&#8212;and here a certain Mr M. with
                    his brother, Captain M., hot from the <pb n="23"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0025.jpg"/> Great War in South Africa, came in most
                    helpfully&#8212;to quicken it.<ptr target="#note15" xml:id="nr15" n="15"/>
                    Manifestly the guns had to be reduced to manageable terms. We cut down the
                    number of shots per move to four, and we required that four men should be within
                    six inches of a gun for it to be in action at all. Without four men it could
                    neither fire nor move&#8212;it was out of action; and if it moved, the four men
                    had to go with it. Moreover, to put an end to that little resistant body of men
                    behind a house, we required that after a gun had been fired it should remain,
                    without alteration of the elevation, pointing in the direction of its last shot,
                    and have two men placed one on either side of the end of its trail. This secured
                    a certain exposure on the part of concealed and sheltered gunners. It was <pb
                        n="24" facs="wells-little-wars 0026.jpg"/> no longer possible to go on
                    shooting out of a perfect security for ever. All this favoured the attack and
                    led to a livelier game. </p>
                <p> Our next step was to abolish the tedium due to the elaborate aiming of the guns,
                    by fixing a time limit for every move. We made this an outside limit at first,
                    ten minutes, but afterwards we discovered that it made the game much more
                    warlike to cut the time down to a length that would barely permit a slow-moving
                    player to fire all his guns and move all his men. This led to small bodies of
                    men lagging and “getting left,” to careless exposures, to rapid, less accurate
                    shooting, and just that eventfulness one would expect in the hurry and passion
                    of real fighting. It also made the game brisker. We have since also <pb n="25"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0027.jpg"/> made a limit, sometimes of four minutes,
                    sometimes of five minutes, to the interval for adjustment and deliberation after
                    one move is finished and before the next move beings. This further removes the
                    game from the chess category, and approximates it to the likeness of active
                    service. Most of a general’s decisions, once a fight has begun, must be made in
                    such brief intervals of time. (But we leave unlimited time at the outset for the
                    planning.) </p>
                <p> As to our time-keeping, we catch a visitor with a stop-watch if we can, and if
                    we cannot, we use a fair-sized clock with a second-hand: the player not moving
                    says “Go,” and warns at the last two minutes, last minute, and last thirty
                    seconds. But I think it would not be difficult to procure a cheap clock&#8212;
                        <pb n="26" facs="wells-little-wars 0028.jpg"/> because, of course, no one
                    wants a very accurate agreement with Greenwich as to the length of a second<ptr
                        target="#note16" xml:id="nr16" n="16"/>&#8212;that would have minutes
                    instead of hours and seconds instead of minutes, and that would ping at the end
                    of every minute and discharge an alarm note at the end of the move. That would
                    abolish the rather boring strain of time-keeping. One could just watch the
                    fighting. </p>
                <p> Moreover, in our desire to bring the game to a climax, we decided that instead
                    of a fight to a finish we would fight to some determined point, and we found
                    very good sport in supposing that the arrival of three men of one force upon the
                    back line of the opponent’s side of the country was of such strategic importance
                    as to determine the battle. But this form of battle we have since <pb n="27"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0029.jpg"/> largely abandoned in favour of the old
                    fight to a finish again. We found it led to one type of battle only, a massed
                    rush at the antagonist’s line, and that our arrangements of time-limits and
                    capture and so forth had eliminated most of the concluding drag upon the game. </p>
                <p>Our game was now very much in its present form. We considered at various times
                    the possibility of introducing some complication due to the bringing up of
                    ammunition or supplies generally, and we decided that it would add little to the
                    interest or reality of the game. Our battles are little brisk fights in which
                    one may suppose that all the ammunition and food needed are carried by the men
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>But our latest development has been <pb n="28" facs="wells-little-wars 0030.jpg"
                    /> in the direction of killing hand to hand or taking prisoners. We found it
                    necessary to distinguish between an isolated force and a force that was merely a
                    projecting part of a larger force. We made a definition of isolation. After a
                    considerable amount of trials we decided that a man or a detachment shall be
                    considered to be isolated when there is less than half its number of its own
                    side within a move of it. Now, in actual civilised warfare small detached bodies
                    do not sell their lives dearly; a considerably larger force is able to make them
                    prisoners without difficulty. Accordingly we decided that if a blue force, for
                    example, has one or more men isolated, and a red force of at least double the
                    strength of this isolated detachment moves up to <pb n="29"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0031.jpg"/> contact with it, the blue men will be
                    considered to be prisoners. </p>
                <p>That seemed fair; but so desperate is the courage and devotion of lead soldiers,
                    that it came to this, that any small force that got or seemed likely to get
                    isolated and caught by a superior force instead of waiting to be taken
                    prisoners, dashed at its possible captors and slew them man for man. It was
                    manifestly unreasonable to permit this. And in considering how best to prevent
                    such inhuman heroisms, we were reminded of another frequent incident in our
                    battles that also erred towards the incredible and vitiated our strategy. That
                    was the charging of one or two isolated horsemen at a gun in order to disable
                    it. Let me illustrate this by an incident. A force consisting of ten infantry
                    and <pb n="30" facs="wells-little-wars 0032.jpg"/> five cavalry with a gun are
                    retreating across an exposed space, and a gun with thirty men, cavalry and
                    infantry, in support comes out upon a crest into a position to fire within two
                    feet of the retreating cavalry. The attacking player puts eight men within six
                    inches of his gun and pushes the rest of his men a little forward to the right
                    or left in pursuit of his enemy. In the real thing, the retreating horsemen
                    would go off to cover with the gun, “hell for leather,”<ptr target="#note17"
                        xml:id="nr17" n="17"/> while the infantry would open out and retreat,
                    firing. But see what happened in our imperfect form of Little War! The move of
                    the retreating player began. Instead of retreating his whole force, he charged
                    home with his mounted desperadoes, killed five of the eight men about the gun,
                    and so by the rule <pb facs="wells-little-wars 0033.jpg"/>

                    <pb n="31" facs="wells-little-wars 0035.jpg"/> silenced it, enabling the rest of
                    his little body to get clean away to cover at the leisurely pace of one foot a
                    move. This was not like any sort of warfare. In real life cavalry cannot pick
                    out and kill its equivalent in cavalry while that equivalent is closely
                    supported by other cavalry or infantry; a handful of troopers cannot gallop past
                    well and abundantly manned gun in action, cut down the gunners and interrupt the
                    fire. And yet for a time we found it a little difficult to frame simple rules to
                    meet these two bad cases and prevent such scandalous possibilities. We did at
                    last contrive to do so; we invented what we call the <emph rend="italic"
                        >mêlée</emph>, and our revised rules in the event of a <emph rend="italic"
                        >mêlée</emph> will be found set out upon a later page. They do really permit
                    something like an actual <pb n="32" facs="wells-little-wars 0036.jpg"/> result
                    to hand-to-hand encounters. They abolish Horatius Cocles.<ptr target="#note18"
                        xml:id="nr18" n="18"/></p>
                <p>We also found difficulties about the capturing of guns. At first we had merely
                    provided that a gun was captured when it was out of action and four men of the
                    opposite force were within six inches of it, but we found a number of cases for
                    which this rule was too vague. A gun, for example, would be disabled and left
                    with only three men within six inches; the enemy would then come up eight or ten
                    strong within six inches on the other side, but not really reaching the gun. At
                    the next move the original possessor of the gun would bring up half a dozen men
                    within six inches. To whom did the gun belong? By the original wording of our
                    rule, it might be supposed to belong to the <pb n="33"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0037.jpg"/> attack which had never really touched
                    the gun yet, and they could claim to turn it upon its original side. We had to
                    meet a number of such cases. We met them by requiring the capturing
                    force&#8212;or, to be precise, four men of it&#8212;actually to pass the axle of
                    the gun before it could be taken.</p>
                <p>All sorts of odd little difficulties arose too, connected with the use of the
                    guns as a shelter from fire, and very exact rules had to be made to avoid
                    tilting the nose and raising the breech of a gun in order to use it as cover. .
                    . .</p>
                <p>We still found it difficult to introduce any imitation into our game of either
                    retreat or the surrender of men not actually taken prisoners in a <emph
                        rend="italic">mêlée</emph>. Both things were possible by the rules, but
                    nobody did them because there was <fw>3</fw>
                    <pb n="34" facs="wells-little-wars 0038.jpg"/> no inducement to do them. Games
                    were apt to end obstinately with the death or capture of the last man. An
                    inducement was needed. This we contrived by playing not for the game but for
                    points, scoring the result of each game and counting the points towards the
                    decision of a campaign. Our campaign was to our single game what a rubber is to
                    a game of whist.<ptr target="#note19" xml:id="nr19" n="19"/> We made the end of
                    a war 200, 300, or 400 or more points up, according to the number of games we
                    wanted to play, and we scored a hundred for each battle won, and in addition 1
                    for each infantry-man, 1 ½ for each cavalry-man, 10 for each gun, ½ for each man
                    held prisoner by the enemy, and ½ for each prisoner held at the end of the game,
                    subtracting what the antagonist scored by the same scale. </p>

                <pb n="35" facs="wells-little-wars 0039.jpg"/>
                <p>Thus, when he felt the battle was hopelessly lost, he had a direct inducement to
                    retreat any guns he could still save and surrender any men who were under the
                    fire of the victors’ guns and likely to be slaughtered, in order to minimise the
                    score against him. And an interest was given to skilful retreat, in which the
                    loser not only saved points for himself but inflicted losses upon the pursuing
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>At first we played the game from the outset, with each player’s force within
                    sight of his antagonist; then we found it possible to hang a double curtain of
                    casement cloth from a string stretched across the middle of the field, and we
                    drew this back only after both sides had set out their men. Without these
                    curtains we found the first player was at a <pb n="36"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0040.jpg"/> heavy disadvantage, because he displayed
                    all his dispositions before his opponent set down his men.</p>
                <p>And at last our rules have reached stability, and we regard them now with the
                    virtuous pride of men who have persisted in a great undertaking and arrived at
                    precision after much tribulation. There is not a piece of constructive
                    legislation in the world, not a solitary attempt to meet a complicated problem,
                    that we do not now regard the more charitably for our efforts to get a right
                    result from this apparently easy and puerile business of fighting with tin
                    soldiers on the floor. </p>
                <p>And so our laws all made, battles have been fought, the mere beginnings, we feel,
                    of vast campaigns. The game has become in a dozen aspects extra- <pb n="37"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0041.jpg"/> ordinarily like a small real battle. The
                    plans are made, the Country hastily surveyed, and then the curtains are closed,
                    and the antagonists make their opening dispositions. Then the curtains are drawn
                    back and the hostile forces come within sight of each other; the little
                    companies and squadrons and batteries appear hurrying to their positions, the
                    infantry deploying into long open lines, the cavalry sheltering in reserve, or
                    galloping with the guns to favourable advance positions. </p>
                <p>In two or three moves the guns are flickering into action, a cavalry <emph
                        rend="italic">mêlée</emph> may be in progress, the plans of the attack are
                    more or less apparent, here are men pouring out from the shelter of a wood to
                    secure some point of vantage, and here are troops massing among <pb n="38"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0042.jpg"/> farm buildings for a vigorous attack.
                    The combat grows hot round some vital point. Move follows move in swift
                    succession. One realises with a sickening sense of error that one is outnumbered
                    and hard pressed here and uselessly cut off there, that one’s guns are
                    ill-placed, that one’s wings are spread too widely, and that help can come only
                    over some deadly zone of fire.</p>
                <p>So the fight wears on. Guns are lost or won, hills or villages stormed or held;
                    suddenly it grows clear that the scales are tilting beyond recovery, and the
                    loser has nothing left but to contrive how he may get to the back line and
                    safety with the vestiges of his command. . . .<ptr target="#note20"

                            timed. The length of time given for each move is determined by the size
                            of the forces engaged. About a minute should be allowed for moving 30
                            men and a minute for each gun. Thus for a force of 110 men and 3 guns,
                            moved by one player, seven minutes is an ample allowance. As the battle
                            progresses and the men are killed off, the allowance is reduced as the
                            players may agree. The player <pb n="42"

                            then proceeds to make his move until time is up. He must instantly stop
                            at the cry of “Time.” Warning should be given by the timekeeper two
                            minutes, one minute, and thirty seconds before time is up. There will be
                            an interval before the next move, during which any disturbance of the
                            Country can be rearranged and men accidentally overturned replaced in a
                            proper attitude. This interval must not exceed five or four minutes, as
                            may be agreed upon. </item>

                            fired at each move, but not both. If it is fired, it may fire as many as
                            four shots in each move. It may be swung round on its axis (the middle
                            point of its wheel axle) to take aim, provided the Country about it
                            permits; it may be elevated or depressed, and the soldiers about it may,
                            at the discretion of the firer, be made to lie down in their places to
                            facilitate its handling. (Moreover, soldiers who have got in front of
                            the fire of their <pb n="45" facs="wells-little-wars 0051.jpg"/> own
                            guns may lie down while the guns fire over them. At the end of the move
                            the guns must be left without altering its elevation and pointing in the
                            direction of the last shot. And after firing, two men must be placed
                            exactly at the end of the trail of the gun, one on either side in a line
                            directly behind the wheels. So much for firing. If the gun is moved and
                            not fired, then at least four men who are with the gun must move up with
                            it to its new position, and be placed within six inches of it in its new
                                position.<ptr target="#note26" xml:id="nr26" n="26"/> The gun itself
                            must be placed trail forward and the muzzle pointing back in the
                            direction from which it came, and so it must remain until it is swung
                            round on its axis to fire.<ptr target="#note27" xml:id="nr27" n="27"/>
                            Obviously the distance which a gun <pb n="46"
                                facs="wells-little-wars 0052.jpg"/> can move will be determined by
                            the men it is with; if there are at least four cavalry-men with it, they
                            can take the gun two feet, but if there are fewer cavalry-men than four
                            and the rest infantry, or no cavalry and all infantry, the gun will be
                            movable only one foot. </item>
                        <item><label>(5)</label> Every man must be placed fairly clear of hills,
                            buildings, trees, guns, etc. He must not be jammed into interstices, and
                            either player may insist upon a clear distance between any man and any
                            gun or other object of at least one-sixteenth of an inch. Nor must men
                            be packed in contact with men. A space of one-sixteenth of an inch
                            should be kept between them. </item>

                            and as many men are dead as a shot knocks over or causes <pb n="47"
                                facs="wells-little-wars 0053.jpg"/>to fall or to lean so that they
                            would fall if unsupported. But if a shot strikes a man but does not
                            knock him over, he is dead, provided the shot has not already killed a
                            man. But a shot cannot kill more than one man without knocking him over,
                            and if it touches several without oversetting them, only the first
                            touched is dead and the others are not incapacitated. A shot that
                            rebounds from or glances off any object and touches a man, kills him; it
                            kills him even if it simply rolls to his feet, subject to what has been

                                            prisoners as the inferior force is less in numbers than
                                            the superior force, and the rest kill each a man and are
                                            killed. Thus nine against eleven have two taken
                                            prisoners, and each side seven men dead. Four of the

                                            seven men, and then four are left with two. </item>

                            on the field after six moves capitulates to the victor. Points count as
                            in the preceding game, but this lasts a shorter time and is better
                            adapted to a cramped country with a short back line. With a long rear
                            line the game is simply a rush at some weak point in the first player’s
                            line by the entire cavalry brigade of the second player. Instead of
                            making the whole back line available for the Blow at the Rear, the

                            defender’s back line. The Country must be made by one or both of the
                            players before it is determined which shall be defender. The players
                            then toss for choice of sides, and the winner of the toss becomes the
                            defender. He puts out his force over the field on his own side, anywhere

                            of the toss becomes first player, and sets out his men a move from his
                            back line. The defender may open fire forthwith; he need not wait until

                        shall be equal in number and similar in composition. The methods of
                        handicapping are obvious. A slight inequality (chances of war) may be
                        arranged between equal players by leaving out 12 men on each side and
                        tossing with a pair of dice to see how many each of player shall take of
                        these. The best arrangement and proportion of the forces is in small bodies
                        of about 20 to 25 infantry-men and 12 to 15 cavalry to a gun. Such a force
                        can manœuvre comfortably on a front of 4 or 5 feet. Most of our games have
                        been played with about 80 infantry,<pb n="60"
                            facs="wells-little-wars 0068.jpg"/> 50 cavalry, 3 or 4 naval guns, and a
                        field gun on either side, or with smaller proportional forces. We have
                        played excellent games on an eighteen-foot battlefield with over two hundred
                        men and six guns a side. A player may, of course, rearrange his forces to
                        suit his own convenience; brigade all or most of his cavalry into a powerful
                        striking force or what not. But more guns proportionally lead to their being
                        put out of action too early for want of men; a larger proportion of infantry
                        makes the game sluggish, and more cavalry&#8212;because of the difficulty of
                        keeping large bodies of this force under cover&#8212;leads simply to early
                        heavy losses by gun-fire and violent and disastrous charging. The
                        composition of a force may, of course, be varied considerably. One good

                        tried as follows: We made the Country, tossed for choice, and then drew
                        curtains across the middle of the field. Each player then selected his force
                        from the available soldiers in this way: he counted infantry as 1 each,
                        cavalry as 1 1/2, and a gun as 10, and, taking whatever he liked in whatever
                        position he liked, he made up a total of 150. He could, for instance, choose
                        100 cavalry and no guns, or 60 infantry, 40 cavalry, and 3 guns. In the
                        result, a Boer-like cavalry force of 80 with 3 guns suffered defeat at the
                        hands of 110 infantry with 4.<ptr target="#note34" xml:id="nr34" n="34"

                        being nearly two inches tall. There is a lighter, cheaper make of perhaps an
                        inch and a half high that is also available. Foreign-made soldiers are of

                <head>THE BATTLE OF HOOK’S FARM</head>
                <p>And now, having given all the exact science of our war game, having told
                    something of the development of this warfare, let me here set out the
                    particulars of an exemplary game. And suddenly your author changes. He changes
                    into what perhaps he might have been&#8212;under different circumstances. His
                    inky fingers become large, manly hands, his drooping scholastic back stiffens,
                    his elbows go out, his etiolated complexion corrugates and darkens, his
                    moustaches increase and grow and spread, and curl up horribly; a large, <pb
                        n="64" facs="wells-little-wars 0074.jpg"/> red scar, a sabre cut, grows
                    lurid over one eye. He expands&#8212;all over he expands. He clears his throat
                    startlingly, lugs at the still growing ends of his moustache, and says, with
                    just a faint and fading doubt in his voice as to whether he can do it, “Yas,
                    Sir!”</p>
                <p>Now for a while you listen to General H. G. W., of the Blue Army. You hear tales
                    of victory. The photographs of the battlefields are by a woman
                    war-correspondent, A. C. W.,<ptr target="#note35" xml:id="nr35" n="35"/> a
                    daring ornament of her sex. I vanish. I vanish, but I will return. Here, then,
                    is the story of the battle of Hook’s Farm. </p>
                <p>“The affair of Hook’s Farm was one of those brisk little things that did so much
                    to build up my early reputation. I did remarkably well, <pb n="65"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0075.jpg"/> though perhaps it is not my function to
                    say so. The enemy was slightly stronger, both in cavalry and infantry, than
                        myself<ref target="#Wellsfn1">*</ref>; he had the choice of position, and
                    opened the ball. Nevertheless I routed him. I had with me a compact little force
                    of 3 guns, 48 infantry, and 25 horse. My instructions were to clear up the
                    country to the east of Firely Church.</p>
                <p>“We came very speedily into touch. I discovered the enemy advancing upon Hook’s
                    Farm and Firely Church, evidently with the intention of holding those two
                    positions and giving me a warm welcome. I have by me a photograph or so of the
                    battlefield <note place="bottom" xml:id="Wellsfn1"> A slight but pardonable
                        error on the part of the gallant gentleman. The forces were exactly
                        equal.</note>
                    <fw>5</fw><pb n="66" facs="wells-little-wars 0076.jpg"/> and also a little
                    sketch I used upon the field. They will give the intelligent reader a far better
                    idea of the encounter than any so-called ‘fine writing’ can do.</p>
                <p>“The original advance of the enemy was through the open country behind Firely
                    Church and Hook’s Farm; I sighted him between the points marked A A and B B, and
                    his force was divided into two columns, with very little cover or possibility of
                    communication between them if once the intervening ground was under fire. I
                    reckoned about 22 to his left and 50 or 60 to his right.<ref target="#wellsIV"
                        >*</ref> Evidently he meant to seize both Firely Church and Hook’s Farm, get
                    his guns into action, and pound my little force to pieces while it was still
                    practically <note place="bottom" xml:id="wellsIV"> Here again the gallant
                        gentleman errs; this time he magnifies.</note><pb n="67"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0077.jpg"/> in the open. He could reach both these
                    admirable positions before I could hope to get a man there. There was no
                    effective cover whatever upon my right that would have permitted an advance up
                    to the church, and so I decided to concentrate my whole force in a rush upon
                    Hook’s Farm, while I staved off his left with gun fire. I do not believe any
                    strategist whatever could have bettered that scheme. My guns were at the points
                    marked D C E, each with five horsemen, and I deployed my infantry in a line
                    between D and E. The rest of my cavalry I ordered to advance on Hook’s Farm from
                    C. I have shown by arrows on the sketch the course I proposed for my guns. The
                    gun E was to go straight for its assigned position, and get into action <pb
                        n="68" facs="wells-little-wars 0078.jpg"/> at once. C was not to risk
                    capture or being put out of action; its exact position was to be determined by
                    Red’s rapidity in getting up to the farm, and it was to halt and get to work
                    directly it saw any chance of effective fire.</p>
                <p>“Red had now sighted us. Throughout the affair he showed a remarkably poor
                    stomach for gun-fire, and this was his undoing. Moreover, he was tempted by the
                    poorness of our cover on our right to attempt to outflank and enfilade<ptr
                        target="#note36" xml:id="nr36" n="36"/> us there. Accordingly, partly to get
                    cover from our two central guns and partly to outflank us, he sent the whole of
                    his left wing to the left of Firely Church, where, except for the gun, it became
                    almost a negligible quantity. The gun came out between the church and the wood
                    into a position from <pb n="69" facs="wells-little-wars 0079.jpg"/> which it did
                    a considerable amount of mischief to the infantry on our right, and nearly drove
                    our rightmost gun in upon its supports. Meanwhile, Red’s two guns on his right
                    came forward to Hook’s Farm, rather badly supported by his infantry.</p>
                <p>“Once they got into position there I perceived that we should be done for, and
                    accordingly I rushed every available man forward in a vigorous counter attack,
                    and my own two guns came lumbering up to the farmhouse corners, and got into the
                    wedge of shelter close behind the house before his could open fire. His fire met
                    my advance, littering the gentle grass slope with dead, and then, hot behind the
                    storm of shell, and even as my cavalry gathered to charge his guns, he charged
                    mine. I was amazed <pb n="70" facs="wells-little-wars 0080.jpg"/> beyond measure
                    at that rush, knowing his sabres to be slightly outnumbered by mine. In another
                    moment all the level space round the farmhouse was a whirling storm of slashing
                    cavalry, and then we found ourselves still holding on, with half a dozen
                    prisoners, and the farmyard a perfect shambles of horses and men. The <emph
                        rend="italic">mêlée</emph> was over. His charge had failed, and, after a
                    brief breathing-space for my shot-torn infantry to come up, I led on the counter
                    attack. It was brilliantly successful; a hard five minutes with bayonet and
                    sabre, and his right gun was in our hands and his central one in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>“And now Red was seized with that most fatal disease of generals, indecision. He
                    would neither abandon his lost gun nor adequately attack it. He sent <pb n="71"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0081.jpg"/> forward a feeble little infantry attack,
                    that we cut up with the utmost ease, taking several prisoners, made a disastrous
                    demonstration from the church, and then fell back altogether from the gentle
                    hill on which Hook farm is situated to a position beside and behind an exposed
                    cottage on the level. I at once opened out into a long crescent, with a gun at
                    either horn, whose crossfire completely destroyed his chances of retreat from
                    this ill-chosen last stand, and there presently we disabled his second gun. I
                    now turned my attention to his still largely unbroken right, from which a gun
                    had maintained a galling fire on us throughout the fight. I might still have had
                    some stiff work getting an attack home to the church, but Red had had enough of
                    it, and <pb n="72" facs="wells-little-wars 0082.jpg"/> now decided to relieve me
                    of any further exertion by a precipitate retreat. My gun to the right of Hook’s
                    Farm killed three of his flying men, but my cavalry were too badly cut up for an
                    effective pursuit, and he got away to the extreme left of his original positions
                    with about 6 infantry-men, 4 cavalry, and 1 gun. He went none too soon. Had he
                    stayed, it would have been only a question of time before we shot him to pieces
                    and finished him altogether.” </p>
                <p>So far, and a little vaingloriously, the general. Let me now shrug my shoulder
                    and shake him off, and go over this battle he describes a little more exactly
                    with the help of the photographs. The battle is a small, compact game of the
                    Fight-to-a-Finish type, and it was arranged as simply <pb

                    a full and exact explanation.</p>
                <p><ref target="#fig1">Figure 1</ref> shows the country of the battlefield put out;
                    on the right is the church, on the left (near the centre of the plate) is the
                    farm. In the hollow between the two is a small outbuilding. Directly behind the
                    farm in the line of vision is another outbuilding. This is more distinctly seen
                    in other photographs. Behind, the chalk back line is clear. Red has won the
                    toss, both for the choice of a side and, after making that choice, for first
                    move, and his force is already put out upon the back line. For the sake of
                    picturesqueness, the men are not put exactly on the line, but each will have his
                    next move measured from that line. Red has broken his force into two, a fatal
                    error, as we <pb n="74" facs="wells-little-wars 0086.jpg"/> shall see, in view
                    of the wide space of open ground between the farm and the church. He has 1 gun,
                    5 cavalry, and 13 infantry on his left, who are evidently to take up a strong
                    position by the church and enfilade Blue’s position; Red’s right, of 2 guns, 20
                    cavalry, and 37 infantry aim at the seizure of the farm.</p>
                <p><ref target="#fig2">Figure 2</ref> is a near view of Blue’s side, with his force
                    put down. He has grasped the strategic mistake of Red, and is going to fling
                    every man at the farm. His right, of 5 cavalry and 16 infantry, will get up as
                    soon as possible to the woods near the centre of the field (whence the fire of
                    their gun will be able to cut off the two portions of Red’s force from each
                    other), and then, leaving the gun there with <pb n="75"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0087.jpg"/> sufficient men to serve it, the rest of
                    this party will push on to co-operate with the main force of their comrades in
                    the inevitable scrimmage for the farm.</p>
                <p><ref target="#fig3">Figure 3 </ref>shows the fight after Red and Blue have both
                    made their first move. It is taken from Red’s side. Red has not as yet realised
                    the danger of his position. His left gun struggles into position to the left of
                    the church, his centre and right push for the farm. Blue’s five cavalry on his
                    left have already galloped forward into a favourable position to open fire at
                    the next move&#8212;they are a little hidden in the picture by the church; the
                    sixteen infantry follow hard, and his main force makes straight for the
                    farm.</p>
                <p><ref target="#fig4">Figure 4</ref> shows the affair developing <pb n="76"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0088.jpg"/> rapidly. Red’s cavalry on his right have
                    taken his two guns well forward into a position to sweep either side of the
                    farm, and his left gun is now well placed to pound Blue’s infantry centre. His
                    infantry continue to press forward, but Blue, for his second move, has already
                    opened fire from the woods with his right gun, and killed three of Red’s men.
                    His infantry have now come up to serve this gun, and the cavalry who brought it
                    into position at the first move have not left it to them in order to gallop over
                    to join the force attacking the farm. Undismayed by Red’s guns, Blue has brought
                    his other two guns and his men as close to the farm as they can go. His leftmost
                    gun stares Red’s in the face, and prevents any effective fire, his middle gun
                    faces Red’s middle gun. <pb n="77" facs="wells-little-wars 0089.jpg"/> Some of
                    his cavalry are exposed to the right of the farm, but most are completely
                    covered now by the farm from Red’s fire. Red has now to move. The nature of his
                    position is becoming apparent to him. His right gun is ineffective, his left and
                    his centre guns cannot kill more than seven or eight men between them; and at
                    the next move, unless he can silence them, Blue’s guns will be mowing his
                    exposed cavalry down from the security of the farm. He is in a fix. How is he to
                    get out of it? His cavalry are slightly outnumbered, but he decides to do as
                    much execution as he can with his own guns, charge the Blue guns before him, and
                    then bring up his infantry to save the situation. </p>
                <p><ref target="#fig5a">Figure 5<emph rend="italic">a</emph></ref> shows the result
                    of Red’s <pb n="78" facs="wells-lw 1.jpg"/> move. His two effective guns have
                    between them bowled over two cavalry and six infantry in the gap between the
                    farm and Blue’s right gun; and then, following up the effect of his gunfire, his
                    cavalry charges home over the Blue guns. One oversight he makes, to which Blue
                    at once calls his attention at the end of his move. Red has reckoned on twenty
                    cavalry for his charge, forgetting that by the rules he must put two men at the
                    tail of his middle gun. His infantry are just not able to come up for this duty,
                    and consequently two cavalry-men have to be set there. The game then pauses
                    while the players work out the cavalry <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph>. Red has
                    brought up eighteen men to this; in touch or within six inches of touch there
                    are twenty-one Blue cavalry. Red’s force <pb n="79" facs="wells-lw 2.jpg"/> is
                    isolated, for only two of his men are within a move, and to support eighteen he
                    would have to have nine. By the rules this gives fifteen men dead on either side
                    and three Red prisoners to Blue. By the rules also it rests with Red to indicate
                    the survivors within the limits of the <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph> as he
                    chooses. He takes very good care there are not four men within six inches of
                    either Blue gun, and both these are out of action therefore for Blue’s next
                    move. Of course Red would have done far better to have charged home with
                    thirteen men only, leaving seven in support, but he was flurried by his
                    comparatively unsuccessful shooting&#8212;he had wanted to hit more
                    cavalry&#8212;and by the gun-trail mistake. Moreover, he had counted his
                    antagonist wrongly, and thought <pb n="80" facs="wells-little-wars 0090.jpg"/>he
                    could arrange a <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph> of twenty against twenty.</p>
                <p>
                    <ref target="#fig5b">Figure 5<emph rend="italic">b</emph></ref> shows the game
                    at the same stage as 5<emph rend="italic">a</emph>, immediately after the
                    adjudication of the <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph>. The dead have been picked
                    up, the three prisoners, by a slight deflection of the rules in the direction of
                    the picturesque, turn their faces towards captivity, and the rest of the picture
                    is exactly in the position of 5<emph rend="italic">a</emph>. </p>
                <p>It is now Blue’s turn to move, and <ref target="#fig6a">figure 6<emph
                            rend="italics">a</emph></ref> shows the result of his move. He fires his
                    rightmost gun (the nose of it is just visible to the right) and kills one
                    infantry-man and one cavalry-man (at the tail of Red’s central gun), brings up
                    his surviving eight cavalry into convenient positions for the service of his
                    temporarily silenced guns, and <pb n="81" facs="wells-little-wars 0091.jpg"
                    />hurries his infantry forward to the farm, recklessly exposing them in the thin
                    wood between the farm and his right gun. The attentive reader will be able to
                    trace all this in <ref target="#fig6a">figure 6<emph rend="italics"
                        >a</emph></ref>, and he will also note the three Red cavalry prisoners going
                    to the rear under the escort of one Khaki infantry man.</p>
                <p>
                    <ref target="#fig6b">Figure 6<emph rend="italics">b</emph></ref> shows exactly

                        >a</emph></ref>, that is to say, the end of Blue’s third move. A cavalry-man
                    lies dead at the tail of Red’s middle gun, an infantry-man a little behind it.
                    His rightmost gun is abandoned and partly masked, but not hidden, from the
                    observer, by a tree to the side of the farmhouse. </p>
                <p>And now, what is Red to do?</p>
                <p>The reader will probably have his own ideas, as I have mine. What Red <fw>6</fw>
                    <pb n="82" facs="wells-little-wars 0092.jpg"/> did do in the actual game was to
                    lose his head, and when at the end of four minutes’ deliberation he had to move,
                    he blundered desperately. He opened fire on Blue’s exposed centre and killed
                    eight men. (Their bodies litter the ground in <ref target="#fig7">figure
                    7</ref>, which gives a complete bird’s-eye view of the battle.) He then sent
                    forward and isolated six or seven men in a wild attempt to recapture his lost
                    gun, massed his other men behind the inadequate cover of his central gun, and
                    sent the detachment of infantry that had hitherto lurked uselessly behind the
                    church, in a frantic and hopeless rush across the open to join them. (The one
                    surviving cavalry-man on his right wing will be seen taking refuge behind the
                    cottage.) There can be little question of the entire <pb n="83"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0093.jpg"/> unsoundness of all these movements. Red
                    was at a disadvantage, he had failed to capture the farm, and his business now
                    was manifestly to save his men as much as possible, make a defensive fight of
                    it, inflict as much damage as possible with his leftmost gun on Blue’s advance,
                    get the remnants of his right across to the church&#8212;the cottage in the
                    centre and their own gun would have given them a certain amount of
                    cover,&#8212;and build up a new position about the building as a pivot. With two
                    guns right and left of the church he might conceivably have saved the rest of
                    the fight.</p>
                <p>That, however, is theory; let us return to fact. <ref target="#fig8">Figure
                        8</ref> gives the disastrous consequences of Red’s last move. Blue has
                    moved, his guns have slaughtered ten of Red’s wretched foot, and a <pb n="84"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0094.jpg"/>rush of nine Blue cavalry and infantry
                    mingles with Red’s six surviving infantry about the disputed gun. These infantry
                    by the definition are <emph rend="italic">isolated</emph>; there are not three
                    other Reds within a move of them. The view in this photograph also is an
                    extensive one, and the reader will note, as a painful accessory, the sad
                    spectacle of three Red prisoners receding to the right. The <emph rend="italic"
                        >mêlée</emph> about Red’s lost gun works out, of course, at three dead on
                    each side, and three more Red prisoners. </p>
                <p>Henceforth the battle moves swiftly to complete the disaster of Red. Shaken and
                    demoralised, that unfortunate general is now only for retreat. His next move, of
                    which I have no picture, is to retreat the infantry he has so wantonly exposed
                    back to the shelter of the church, to <pb facs="wells-little-wars 0095.jpg"/>

                    throw forward his left gun into a position commanding Blue’s right. </p>
                <p>Blue then pounds Red’s right with his gun to the right of the farm and kills
                    three men. He extends his other gun to the left of the farm, right out among the
                    trees, so as to get an effective fire next time upon the tail of Red’s gun. He
                    also moves up sufficient men to take possession of Red’s lost gun. On the right
                    Blue’s gun engages Red’s and kills one man. All this the reader will see clearly
                    in <ref target="#fig9">figure 9</ref>, and he will also note a second batch of
                    Red prisoners&#8212;this time they are infantry, going rearward. <ref
                        target="#fig9">Figure 9</ref> is the last picture that is needed to tell the
                    story <pb n="86" facs="wells-little-wars 0098.jpg"/>of the battle. Red’s
                    position is altogether hopeless. He has four men left alive by his rightmost
                    gun, and their only chance is to attempt to save that by retreating with it. If
                    they fire it, one or other will certainly be killed at its tail in Blue’s
                    subsequent move, and then the gun will be neither movable nor fireable. Red’s
                    left gun, with four men only, is also in extreme peril, and will be immovable
                    and helpfulness if it loses another man. </p>
                <p>Very properly Red decided upon retreat. His second gun had to be abandoned after
                    one move, but two of the men with it escaped over his back line. Five of the
                    infantry behind the church escaped, and his third gun and its four cavalry got
                    away on the extreme left-hand corner of Red’s position. <pb n="87"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0099.jpg"/>Blue remained on the field, completely
                    victorious, with two captured guns and six prisoners. </p>
                <p>There you have a scientific record of the worthy general’s little affair.</p>

                <head>EXTENSIONS AND AMPLIFICATIONS OF LITTLE WAR</head>
                <p>Now that battle of Hook’s Farm is, as I have explained, a simplification of the
                    game, set out entirely to illustrate the method of playing; there is scarcely a
                    battle that will not prove more elaborate (and eventful) than this little
                    encounter. If a number of players and a sufficiently large room can be got,
                    there is no reason why armies of many hundreds of soldiers should not fight over
                    many square yards of model country. So long as each player has about a hundred
                    men and three guns <pb n="89" facs="wells-little-wars 0101.jpg"/>there is no
                    need to lengthen the duration of a game on that account. But it is too laborious
                    and confusing for a single player to handle more than that number of men.</p>
                <p>Moreover, on a big floor with an extensive country it is possible to begin moving
                    with moves double or treble the length here specified, and to come down to moves
                    of the ordinary lengths when the troops are within fifteen or twelve or ten feet
                    of each other. To players with the time and space available I would suggest
                    using a quite large country, beginning with treble moves, and, with the
                    exception of a select number of cavalry scouts, keeping the soldiers in their
                    boxes <emph rend="italic">with the lids on</emph>, and moving the boxes as
                    units. (This boxing idea is a new one, and affords a <pb n="90"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0102.jpg"/>very good substitute for the curtain; I
                    have tried it twice for games in the open air where the curtain was not
                    available.) Neither side would, of course, know what the other had in its boxes;
                    they might be packed regiments or a mere skeleton force. Each side would advance
                    on the other by double or treble moves behind a screen of cavalry scouts, until
                    a scout was within ten feet of a box on the opposite side. Then the contents of
                    that particular box would have to be disclosed and the men stood out. Troops
                    without any enemy within twenty feet could be returned to their boxes for
                    facility in moving. Playing on such a scale would admit also of the introduction
                    of the problem of provisions and supplies. Little toy Army Service <pb n="91"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0103.jpg"/> waggons can be bought, and it could be
                    ruled that troops must have one such waggon for every fifty men within at least
                    six moves. Moreover, ammunition carts may be got, and it may be ruled that one
                    must be within two moves of a gun before the latter can be fired. All these are
                    complications of the War Game, and so far I have not been able to get together
                    sufficient experienced players to play on this larger, more elaborate scale. It
                    is only after the smaller simpler war game here described has been played a
                    number of times, and its little dodges mastered completely, that such more
                    warlike devices become practicable.</p>
                <p>But obviously with a team of players and an extensive country, one could have a
                    general controlling the whole <pb n="92" facs="wells-little-wars 0104.jpg"/>
                    campaign, divisional commanders, batteries of guns, specialised brigades, and a
                    quite military movement of the whole affair. I have (as several illustrations
                    show) tried Little Wars in the open air. The toy soldiers stand quite well on
                    closely mown grass, but the long-range gun-fire becomes a little uncertain if
                    there is any breeze. It gives a greater freedom of movement and allows the
                    players to lie down more comfortably when firing, to increase, and even double,
                    the moves of the indoor game. One can mark out high roads and streams with an
                    ordinary lawn-tennis marker, mountains and rocks of stones, and woods and
                    forests of twigs are easily arranged. But if the game is to be left out all
                    night and continued next day (a thing I have as yet had no <pb n="93"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0105.jpg"/> time to try), the houses must be of some
                    more solid material than paper. I would suggest painted blocks of wood. On a
                    large lawn, a wide country-side may be easily represented. The players may begin
                    with a game exactly like the ordinary Kriegspiel, with scouts and boxed
                    soldiers, which will develop into such battles as are here described, as the
                    troops come into contact. It would be easy to give the roads a real significance
                    by permitting a move half as long again as in the open country for waggons or
                    boxed troops along a road. There is a possibility of having a toy railway, with
                    stations or rolling stock into which troops might be put, on such a giant war
                    map. One would allow a move for entraining and another for detraining, requiring
                        <pb n="94" facs="wells-little-wars 0106.jpg"/> the troops to be massed
                    alongside the train at the beginning and end of each journey, and the train
                    might move at four or five times the cavalry rate. One would use open trucks and
                    put in a specified number of men&#8212;say twelve infantry or five cavalry or
                    half a gun per truck,&#8212;and permit an engine to draw seven or eight trucks,
                    or move at a reduced speed with more. One could also rule that four
                    men&#8212;the same four men&#8212;remaining on a line during two moves, could
                    tear up a rail, and eight men in three moves replace it.</p>
                <p>I will confess I have never yet tried over these more elaborate developments of
                    Little Wars, partly because of the limited time at my disposal, and partly
                    because they all demand a number of <pb n="95" facs="wells-little-wars 0107.jpg"
                    /> players who are well acquainted with the game on each side if they are not to
                    last interminably. The Battle of Hook’s Farm (one player a side) took a whole
                    afternoon, and most of my battles have lasted the better part of a day.</p>

                <head>ENDING WITH A SORT OF CHALLENGE</head>
                <p>I could go on now and tell of battles, copiously. In the memory of the one
                    skirmish I have given I do but taste blood. I would like to go on, to a large,
                    thick book. It would be an agreeable task. Since I am the chief inventor and
                    practiser (so far) of Little Wars, there has fallen to me a disproportionate
                    share of victories. But let me not boast. For the present, I have done all that
                    I meant to do in this matter. It is for you, dear reader, now to get a floor, a
                    friend, some soldiers and some guns, and show by a grove-<pb n="97"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0109.jpg"/>ling devotion your appreciation of this
                    noble and beautiful gift of a limitless game that I have given you.</p>
                <p>And if I might for a moment trumpet! How much better is this amiable miniature
                    than the Real Thing! Here is a homeopathic remedy for the imaginative
                    strategist. Here is the premeditation, the thrill, the strain of accumulating
                    victory or disaster&#8212;and no smashed nor sanguinary bodies, no shattered
                    fine buildings nor devastated country sides, no petty cruelties, none of that
                    awful universal boredom and embitterment, that tiresome delay or stoppage or
                    embarrassment of every gracious bold, sweet, and charming thing, that we who are
                    old enough to remember a real modern war know to be the reality of belligerence.
                    This world is <fw>7</fw><pb n="98" facs="wells-little-wars 0110.jpg"/> for ample
                    living; we want security and freedom; all of us in every country, except a few
                    dull-witted, energetic bores, want to see the manhood of the world at something
                    better than apeing the little lead toys our children buy in boxes. We want fine
                    things made for mankind&#8212;splendid cities, open ways, more knowledge and
                    power, and more and more and more,&#8212;and so I offer my game, for a
                    particular as well as general end; and let us put this prancing monarch and that
                    silly scaremonger, and these excitable “patriots,” and those adventurers, and
                    all the practitioners of <emph rend="italic">Welt Politik</emph>,<ptr

                    down, and cities and fortresses, and unlimited <pb n="99"
                        facs="wells-little-wars 0111.jpg"/> soldiers&#8212;tons,

                <p>My game is just as good as their game, and saner by reason of its size. Here is
                    War, done down to rational proportions, and yet out of the way of mankind, even
                    as our fathers turned human sacrifices into the eating of little images and
                    symbolic mouthfuls. For my own part, I am <emph rend="italic">prepared</emph>. I
                    have nearly five hundred men, more than a score of guns, and I twirl my
                    moustache and hurl defiance eastward from my home in Essex across the narrow
                    seas. Not only eastward. I would conclude this little discourse with one other
                    disconcerting and exasperating sentence for the admirers and practitioners of
                    Big War. I have never yet met in <pb n="100" facs="wells-little-wars 0112.jpg"/>
                    little battle any military gentleman, any captain, major, colonel, general, or
                    eminent commander, who did not presently get into difficulties and confusions
                    among even the elementary rules of the Battle. You have only to play at Little
                    Wars three or four times to realise just what a blundering thing Great War must
                    be. </p>
                <p> Great War is at present, I am convinced, not only the most expensive game in the
                    universe, but it is a game out of all proportion. Not only are the masses of men
                    and material and suffering and inconvenience too monstrously big for reason,
                    but&#8212;the available heads we have for it, are too small. That, I think is
                    the most pacific realisation conceivable, and Little War brings you to it as
                    nothing else but Great War can do. </p>

                <head>APPENDIX</head>
                <head>LITTLE WARS AND KRIEGSPIEL</head>
                <p>This little book has, I hope, been perfectly frank about its intentions. It is
                    not a book upon Kriegspeil. It gives merely a game that may be played by two or
                    four or six amateurish persons in an afternoon and evening with toy soldiers.
                    But it has a very distinct relation to Kriegspiel; and since the main portion of
                    it was written and published in a magazine, I have had quite a considerable
                    correspondence with military people who have been interested by it, and who have
                    shown a very friendly spirit towards it&#8212;in spite of the pacific outbreak
                    in its concluding section. They tell me&#8212;what I already a little
                    suspected&#8212;that Kriegspiel, as it is played by the British Army, is a very
                    dull and unsatisfactory exercise, lacking in realism, in stir and the
                    unexpected, obsessed by the umpire at every turn, and of doubtful value in
                    waking up the imagination, which should be its chief function. I am particularly
                    indebted to Colonel Mark Sykes<ptr target="#note38" xml:id="nr38" n="38"/> for
                    advice and information in this matter. He has pointed out to me the possibility
                    of developing Little Wars into a vivid and inspiring Kriegspiel, in which the
                    element of the umpire would be reduced to a minimum; and it would be ungrateful
                    to him, and a waste of an interesting opportunity, if I did not add this
                    Appendix, pointing out how a Kriegspiel of real educational value for junior
                    officers may be developed out of the amusing methods of Little War. If Great War
                    is to be played at all, the better it is played the more humanely it will be
                    done. I see no inconsistency in deploring the practice while perfecting the
                    method. But I am a civilian, and Kriegspiel is not my proper business. I <pb
                        n="102" facs="wells-little-wars 0114.jpg"/> am deeply preoccupied with a
                    novel I am writing,<ptr target="#note39" xml:id="nr39" n="39"/> and so I think
                    the best thing I can do is just to set down here all the ideas that have cropped
                    up in my mind, in the footsteps, so to speak, of Colonel Sykes, and leave it to
                    the military expert, if he cares to take the matter up, to reduce my scattered
                    suggestions to a system.</p>
                <p>Now, first, it is manifest that in Little Wars there is no equivalent for
                    rifle-fire, and that the effect of the gun-fire has no resemblance to the effect
                    of shell. That may be altered very simply. Let the rules as to gun-fire be as
                    they are now, but let a different projectile be used&#8212;a projectile that
                    will drop down and stay where it falls. I find that one can buy in ironmongers’
                    shops small brass screws of various sizes and weights, but all capable of being
                    put in the muzzle of the 4.7 guns without slipping down the barrel. If, with
                    such a screw in the muzzle, the gun is loaded and fired, the wooden bolt remains
                    in the gun and the screw flies and drops and stays near where it falls&#8212;its
                    range being determined by the size and weight of screw selected by the gunner.
                    Let us assume this is a shell, and it is quite easy to make a rule that will
                    give the effect of its explosion. Half, or, in the case of an odd number, one
                    more than half, of the men within three inches of this shell are dead, and if
                    there is a gun completely within the circle of three inches radius from the
                    shell, it is destroyed. If it is not completely within the circle, it is
                    disabled for two moves. A supply waggon is completely destroyed if it falls
                    wholly or partially within the radius. But if there is a wall, house, or
                    entrenchment between any men and the shell, they are uninjured&#8212;they do not
                    count in the reckoning of the effect of the shell.</p>
                <p>I think one can get a practical imitation of the effect of rifle-fire by deciding
                    that for every five infantry-men who are roughly in a line, and who do not move
                    in any particular move, there may be one (ordinary) shot taken with a 4.7 gun.
                    It may be fired from <pb n="103" facs="wells-little-wars 0115.jpg"/> any
                    convenient position behind the row of five men, so long as the shot passes
                    roughly over the head of the middle man of the five.</p>
                <p>Of course, while in Little Wars there are only three or four players, in any
                    proper Kriegspiel the game will go on over a larger area&#8212;in a drill-hall
                    or some such place,&#8212;and each arm and service will be entrusted to a
                    particular player. This permits all sorts of complicated imitations of reality
                    that are impossible to our parlour and playroom Little Wars. We can consider
                    transport, supply, ammunition, and the moral effect of cavalry impact, and of
                    uphill and downhill movements. We can also bring in the spade and entrenchment,
                    and give scope to the Royal Engineers. But before I write anything of Colonel
                    Sykes’ suggestions about these, let me say a word or two about Kriegspiel
                    “country.”</p>
                <p>The country for Kriegspiel should be made up, I think, of heavy blocks or boxes
                    of wood about 3 &#10005; 3 &#10005; ½ feet, and curved pieces (with a rounded
                    outline and a chord of three feet, or shaped like right-angled triangles with an
                    incurved hypotenuse and two straight sides of 3 feet) can easily be contrived to
                    round off corners and salient angles. These blocks can be bored to take tree,
                    etc., exactly as the boards in Little Wars are bored, and with them a very
                    passable model of any particular country can be built up from a contoured
                    Ordnance map. Houses may be made very cheaply by shaping a long piece of wood
                    into a house-like section and sawing it up. There will always be someone who
                    will touch up and paint and stick windows on to and generally adorn and
                    individualise such houses, which are, of course, the stabler the heavier the
                    wood used. The rest of the country as in Little Wars.</p>
                <p>Upon such a country a Kriegspiel could be played with rules upon the lines of the
                    following sketch rules, which are the result of a discussion between Colonel
                    Sykes and myself, and in which most of the new ideas are to be ascribed to
                    Colonel Sykes. We proffer them, not as a finished set of rules, but as material
                    for <pb n="104" facs="wells-little-wars 0116.jpg"/> anyone who chooses to work
                    over them, in the elaboration of what we believe will be a far more exciting and
                    edifying Kriegspiel than any that exists at the present time. The game may be
                    played by any number of players, according to the forces engaged and the size of
                    the country available. Each side will be under the supreme command of a General,
                    who will be represented by a cavalry soldier. The player who is General must
                    stand at or behind his representative image and within six feet of it. His
                    signalling will be supposed to be perfect, and he will communicate with his
                    subordinates by shout, whisper, or note, as he thinks fit. I suggest he should
                    be considered invulnerable, but Colonel Sykes has proposed arrangements for his
                    disablement. He should have it that if the General falls within the zone of
                    destruction of a shell he must go out of the room for three moves (injured); and
                    that if he is hit by rifle-fire or captured he shall quit the game, and be
                    succeeded by his next subordinate.</p>

                        forth, that will be quite easily worked out upon the model of boat

                        of a shell will be of course destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The toy soldiers used in this Kriegspiel should not be the large soldiers
                        used in Little Wars. The British manufacturers who turn out these also make
                        a smaller, cheaper type of man&#8212;the infantry about an inch
                        high&#8212;which is better adapted to Kriegspiel purposes.</p>
                    <p>We hope, if these suggestions “catch on,” to induce them to manufacture a
                        type of soldier more exactly suited to the needs of the game, including tray
                        carriers for troops in formation and (what is at present not attainable)

                        make it into an exacter and more realistic game. In doing so, we think they
                        will find it advisable to do their utmost <emph rend="italic">to make the
                            game work itself</emph>, and to keep the need for umpire’s decisions at
                        a minimum. Whenever possible, death should be by actual gun- and rifle-fire
                        and not by computation. Things should happen, and not be decided. We would
                        also like to insist upon the absolute need of an official upon either side,
                        simply to watch and measure the moves taken, and to collect and check the
                        amounts of supply and ammunition given up. This is a game like real war,
                        played against time, and played under circumstances of considerable
                        excitement, and it is remarkable <pb n="111"

                <note xml:id="note1">Wells is referencing Laurence Sterne’s <emph rend="italic">The
                        Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen</emph> (1767). In this book,
                    Tristram’s Uncle Toby recreates the War of the Spanish Succession to the scale
                    of his bowling green. </note>
                <note xml:id="note2">The cannons Wells used were built by the British toymaker
                    William Britain. Wells specifically used Britain’s spring-powered 4.7 Naval Gun.
                    Throughout <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> Wells uses the term "gun"
                    instead of "cannon." Since "gun" might lead to some confusion for modern readers
                    and players, we have changed the wording to "cannon" in our Streamlined
                    Rules.</note>
                <note xml:id="note3">The 4.7 gun was a 120 mm (roughly 4.7 in) artillery gun. Wells
                    used William Britain’s spring-powered 4.7 Naval Gun.</note>
                <note xml:id="note4">Wells lived in Sandgate from 1901 to 1909.</note>
                <note xml:id="note5">J.K.J is short for Jerome K. Jerome, an English writer and
                    Wells’s friend.</note>
                <note xml:id="note6">Wells is most likely referencing Emerson’s “Concord Hymn”: <lg>
                        <l>By the rude bridge that arched the flood,</l>
                        <l>Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,</l>
                        <l>Here once the embattled farmers stood</l>
                        <l>And fired the shot heard round the world.</l>

                <note xml:id="note7">The Cannon of Valmy (1792) was a major French victory against
                    the Prussians during the French Revolutionary Wars. </note>
                <note xml:id="note8">Mr. W. is most likely Graham Wallas, a close friend of H. G.
                    Wells. They both held similar views, which led them both to leave the
                    contemporary socialist organization, the Fabian Society.</note>
                <note xml:id="note9"><emph rend="italic">Kriegspiel</emph>s were war games invented
                    in 19th century Prussia. Unlike Wells’s games, these games relied on umpires and
                    dice rolls. </note>
                <note xml:id="note10">Wells appears to be referring to George Gissing who stayed
                    with him in Sandgate for two months in 1901.</note>
                <note xml:id="note11">Wells describes this “box of bricks” at length in <emph
                        rend="italic">Floor Games</emph>: “What this great benefactor did was to
                    engage a deserving unemployed carpenter through an entire winter making big
                    boxes of wooden bricks for the almost innumerable nephews and nieces with which
                    an appreciative circle of brothers and sisters had blessed him. There are whole
                    bricks 4½ inches x 2¼ x 11/8; there are half bricks 2 ¼ x 2 ¼ x 1 ⅛; and there
                    are quarters—called by those previous owners (who have now ascended to, we hope
                    but scarcely believe, a happier life near the ceiling) ‘piggys.’ You note how
                    these sizes fit into the sizes of our boards, and of each size—we have never
                    counted them, but we must have hundreds. We can pave a dozen square yards of
                    floor with them” (16). A very similar passage appears in Wells’s <emph
                        rend="italic">The New Machiavelli</emph>. </note>
                <note xml:id="note12">“Creepers” are presumably vines.</note>
                <note xml:id="note13">This alludes to Bottom’s lines in <emph rend="italic">A
                        Midsummer Night’s Dream</emph>: <lg>
                        <l>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</l>
                        <l>bring in&#8212;God shield us!&#8212;a lion among ladies, is a</l>
                        <l>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</l>
                        <l>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</l>

                    </lg></note>
                <note xml:id="note14">Wells is referencing the military theorist Ivan Bloch who
                    published “Is War Now Impossible: Being an Abridgment of the War of the Future
                    in its Technical, Economic and Political Relations” in 1899. In it, he writes “I
                    have arrived at the conclusion, based upon a very careful examination of various
                    authorities, that the day of the bayonet is over.”</note>
                <note xml:id="note15">This refers to the 1906-1907 Bambatha Rebellion where the Zulu
                    revolted against the British. We have been unable to identify Captain M. or Mr.
                    M.</note>
                <note xml:id="note16">It was decided at the 1884 International Meridian Conference
                    that the prime meridian would be based at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
                    effectively creating “Greenwich Mean Time” (GMT). J.R. Sinclair’s illustration
                    on page 25 of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> humorously shows a “minute
                    clock” with the label “HGW Mean Time” for H.G. Wells.</note>
                <note xml:id="note17">An idiom meaning “as fast as possible.”</note>
                <note xml:id="note18">Publius Horatius Cocles was a legendary Roman soldier. It is
                    said that Cocles defended the Sublician Bridge in Rome from the Etruscan army
                    all by himself until the bridge could be destroyed. Wells wanted to avoid such
                    acts of extraordinary mythical heroism in <emph rend="italic">Little
                    Wars</emph>.</note>
                <note xml:id="note19">In Whist, a “rubber” means the best of three games.</note>
                <note xml:id="note20">An implied rule; if a player moves their units to their back
                    line, they essentially retreat and are removed from battle, but still count
                    towards your points for alive units. </note>
                <note xml:id="note21">Wells uses “move” to mean both a player’s turn and the actual
                    advancement of units on the field. In the Streamlined Rules, we use “move”
                    solely for the movement of units, and “turn” for the time allowed for player’s
                    to act. </note>
                <note xml:id="note22">This rule is made distinct from the rest of this grouping in
                    the Streamlined Rules, as this rule dictates actions that occur during the
                    setting up of the game, rather than during a player’s turn. </note>
                <note xml:id="note23">While Wells's description is complicated, he is just
                    stipulating that a gcannon cannot be fired on a player's first turn. We have
                    simplified this explanation in the Streamlined Rules.</note>
                <note xml:id="note24">Because cannons may not be moved without units manning it,
                    this rule necessitates that units manning a cannon be allowed to move with the
                    cannon. </note>
                <note xml:id="note25">Wells never states that prisoners cannot man guns, but given
                    his dedication to realistic battle, Wells most likely did not intend for this.
                    However, if four prisoners are near a gun, the rules as written allow for those
                    prisoners to man the gun and fire it on their turn. We have specified in the
                    Streamlined Rules that prisoners cannot interact with the cannons.</note>
                <note xml:id="note26">Players may exploit this rule to give more movement to
                    infantry units. With four cavalry, the gun would be able to move two feet, but
                    since the gun can also carry with it all units within six inches, a player could
                    crowd the gun with infantry units in addition to the cavalry, thereby moving the
                    infantry two feet instead of their typical 1 foot movement speed. </note>
                <note xml:id="note27">Field carriages allowed guns to be moved across the field.
                    When positioned, the “trail” rests on the ground away from the direction of
                    fire. To move the gun, it would have to be pulled rather than pushed as Wells’s
                    rules reflect.</note>
                <note xml:id="note28">A shot kills the first unit it knocks over, and any others
                    that fall with that unit. </note>
                <note xml:id="note29">This rule could lead to some interesting situations, as it
                    suggests the possibility of amassing a larger <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph>
                    as a result of two <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph> coming within 6 inches of
                    each other. </note>
                <note xml:id="note30">The wording here may imply that a prisoner is freed by the
                    death of any single escort. We believe the intention is that all escorts
                    surrounding a prisoner must be defeated before the prisoner can be said to be
                    liberated. This is resolved in the Streamlined Rules by checking a prisoner’s
                    status at the end of a turn to see if it has any sort of escort.</note>
                <note xml:id="note31">This rule suggests that an escort can voluntarily leave a
                    prisoner without an escort at any time.</note>
                <note xml:id="note32">Wells’s wording here is absolute, but this does open up the
                    problem that if an escort with a prisoner passes by a cannon of the prisoner’s
                    side, the escort cannot claim the cannon, as the prisoner would stop them from
                    doing so. This may have been an intended consequence of taking prisoners, or
                    makes being an escort at moments possibly disadvantageous. See also note 24, for
                    further complications with prisoners and guns.</note>
                <note xml:id="note33">That is, if the cannon would be considered <emph rend="italic"
                        >manned</emph> by a player on their next turn.</note>
                <note xml:id="note34">The heavy loss of horses and cavalry during the Second Boer

                    read each other's works before they worked on the extended <emph rend="italic"
