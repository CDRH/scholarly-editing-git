                <head>Introduction</head>
                <byline>Deanna Stover and Nigel Lepianka</byline>
                <p>H. G. Wells (1866&#8211;1946) published two books about play with miniatures
                    (specifically, toy soldiers): <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> in
                    1911, and then <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> in 1913. In <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph>,
                    Wells explains the supplies needed to create a world on the nursery floor and
                    dramatizes his sons’ play. <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>, however,
                    provides a more complex, codified game. More importantly, <emph rend="italic"
                        >Little Wars</emph> was unprecedented. As Jon Peterson notes, it was the
                    first time “miniature wargame rules [were] marketed in book form to the general
                        public.”<ptr target="#note1" xml:id="nr1" n="1"/>
                    <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> continues to be influential on modern
                    gaming: the book has become the norm for popular role-playing game rulebooks
                    such as <emph rend="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</emph> and <emph
                        rend="italic">Pathfinder</emph>. Although <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> has always remained in print since its first publication, and later
                    editions feature forewords by influential figures including writer Isaac Asimov
                    and <emph rend="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</emph> creator Gary Gygax, to
                    date there has not been a critical scholarly edition of the text.</p>
                <p>As a rulebook, the primary goal of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> is, in
                    the end, to produce play (even if it is play with an ideological bent&#8212;in
                    this case, pacifism). However, the text is far more than a straightforward
                    account of rules. Esther MacCallum-Stewart points out that <emph rend="italic"
                        >Little Wars</emph> consists of three main sections: an early version of the
                    “development diary” (chapter 2); a rules section (chapter 3); and an
                    “example of play” detailing Wells’s successful “Battle of Hook’s Farm” (chapter
                        4).<ptr target="#note2" xml:id="nr2" n="2"/> Like writers of modern development
                    diaries, Wells uses chapter 2 to chronicle how the game began and how it changed
                    through play-testing various iterations.  He records successes and failures;
                    explains the reasoning behind certain rules; and gives advice about setting up
                    "The Country" where the wars will take place, the making of which he had previously
                    detailed in <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph>. </p>
                <p>Black-and-white photographs of play and setup taken by Wells’s wife and marginal
                    illustrations by J. R. Sinclair accompany the text. The illustrations, photos,
                    and text all interact, which is partially why current digital transcripts that
                    fail to include the marginal illustrations do not accurately represent <emph rend="italic">Little
                    Wars</emph>. A few photographs feature Wells and his opponent, Jerome K.
                    Jerome, thereby helping to show the scale of the battles, but many other photos show how
                    incredibly detailed Wells’s sets were. Moreover, these sets are often shot in a
                    way that makes them seem life-size rather than in miniature. The marginal
                    illustrations similarly depict both lifeless figurines in a player's hand or
                     placed behind books as if for cover and seemingly animate toys in
                    naturalistic settings.</p>
                <p>This tension between game and fiction exists throughout <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph>. When describing the Battle of Hook’s Farm, Wells adopts the persona of a general,
                    and what follows is more like a short story than simply a description of play:
                        <quote>And suddenly your author changes. He changes into what perhaps he
                        might have been&#8212;under different circumstances. His inky fingers become
                        large, manly hands, his drooping scholastic back stiffens, his elbows go
                        out, his etiolated complexion corrugates and darkens, his moustaches
                        increase and grow and spread, and curl up horribly; a large, red scar, a
                        sabre cut, grows lurid over one eye. He expands&#8212;all over he
                            expands.<ptr target="#note3" xml:id="nr3" n="3"/></quote>It is here, in Wells's narration, where we can begin to see elements of modern role-playing
                    games (RPGs) where players adopt personas. Wells clearly sees his games as
                    participatory literature. The title to chapter 6, “Ending with a Sort of
                    Challenge,” is joined by an illustration of a bookcase labeled “Little Wars,”
                    topped with a general’s bust and featuring nineteen volumes of books&#8212;books that
                    may depict his readers’ wars as much as his own. And yet, potential stories must
                    still exist within a set of rules. Like in modern RPGs, prescribed guidelines
                    add structure to a game; limitations allow for more interesting play because
                    players must strategically and creatively navigate through a fixed framework to
                    win. In the end, as many gamers will agree, the story that plays out as a result
                    of these rules is as satisfying as any victory. </p>
                <p>While <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> is much more than rules, our approach to this critical edition is
                    meant to frame the text around the rules and suggestions of gameplay prescribed
                    in chapter 3 in order to highlight the participatory nature of Wells's work. Although it is a narrative in its own right, <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> gives its readers and players (mutually
                    inclusive groups that they are) the chance to create their own narratives. It
                    could be argued that other works or texts could allow for such a phenomenon, and
                    we would not presume <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> and other game
                    manuals to be the sole purveyors of such a productive element of literary works;
                    however, game manuals like <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> presuppose as
                    their <emph rend="italic">raison d’être</emph> that the game will be played.
                    Readers will interact with and build on the initial text, creating narratives
                    that even Wells at his most fantastical could not predict. In addition, we see
                    our edition of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> as a contribution to the
                    growing scholarly body on games and gaming. Part of our purpose here is to begin
                    a conversation about how to use current TEI standards to encode rules.<ptr target="#note4" xml:id="nr4"
                        n="4"/> We have explained our choices below and
                    hope that our decisions will continue to be refined as similar projects
                    develop.</p>
                <p>In order to emphasize that <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> is both a
                    readable text <emph rend="italic">and</emph> a playable game, we have also
                    included TEI-encoded streamlined rules. Asides and narratives often accompany
                    Wells’s rules, and we felt that simplifying and clarifying the rules would help
                    make gameplay more accessible. Although Wells sketches out ideas for adjusting <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> for military training in an appendix, our streamlined rules privilege Wells's original rule set. Of course, readers should feel free to read through and play along with Wells’s addenda as well. In either case we invite readers to engage with <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> by creating their own miniature battles. As Wells himself
                    demands: “It is for you, dear reader, now to get a floor, a friend, some
                    soldiers and some guns, and show by a groveling devotion your appreciation of
                    this noble and beautiful gift of limitless game that I have given you.”<ptr

                <head>The Context</head>
                <p>Wells’s <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> came out of a contemporary growing cultural interest in toy
                    soldiers (also referred to as miniatures, a term that allows for a more varied
                    understanding of small figurines used for play or display). The Prussian
                    invention of <emph rend="italic">kriegspiel</emph> was a watershed moment for the
                    creation and use of structured systems for simulating war and helped to spur the
                    growth of toy industries at the turn of the twentieth century. <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> represents Wells’s expansion of and
                    response to the war-game concept. However, the books were not Wells’s idea.
                        <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> came about after a small publisher, Frank Palmer,
                    reached out to Wells (already an established and popular author at this point)
                    and asked him to write a book about games for children. Wells obviously agreed, penning <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> soon after.
                    His second book for Palmer, <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>, would be
                    published in 1913, but it was first serialized (without J. R. Sinclair’s
                    illustrations but under the copyright of Frank Palmer) in the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Windsor Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly for Men and Women</emph>
                    beginning in December 1912.<ptr target="#note6" xml:id="nr6" n="6"/></p>
                <p>While most of the changes between the serial and volume versions of <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> consist of grammatical emendations, Wells
                    added a fourth chapter, "Extensions and Amplifications of Little War," and an
                    appendix to the 1913 publication. These sections introduce additional ideas
                    (some tested, some not) for more advanced play, both as a larger, more
                    challenging version of his original Little War or as a <emph rend="italic"
                        >kriegspiel</emph> meant for military training purposes (something he devised
                    with the help of Colonel Mark Sykes). In both cases, we can see how Wells
                    continued to devote time and energy into his creation. </p>
                <p>Certainly <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> were not the first or the last instances of Wells writing about
                    play with miniatures. Palmer recruited Wells after reading the author’s
                    semi-autobiographical and controversial novel <emph rend="italic">The New
                        Machiavelli</emph>, first serialized in 1910. The novel features multiple
                    references to the war games played by the main character, Dick Remington, and his friend
                    Britten:<ptr target="#note7" xml:id="nr7" n="7"/> <quote>We
                        developed a war game of our own at Britten’s home with nearly a couple of
                        hundred lead soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot hard and true
                        at six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated set of rules. For
                        some months that occupied an immense proportion of our leisure. Some of the
                        battles lasted several days. We kept the game a profound secret from the
                        other fellows. They would not have understood.<ptr target="#note8"
                            xml:id="nr8" n="8"/></quote>However, unlike Dick Remington, Palmer knew
                    that “other fellows” would certainly understand the appeal of staging little
                    wars&#8212;he was tapping into an already popular and ever-growing market. </p>
                <p>In 1893 William Britain had revolutionized the toy world by introducing hollow
                    miniatures, making them more affordable. Due in part to the general increase in
                    leisure time, literacy, and income among the middle class, toys became a
                    staple during the latter half of the nineteenth century.<ptr target="#note9"
                        xml:id="nr9" n="9"/> In fact, Kenneth Brown identifies in particular a
                    “toy soldier craze” in the two decades leading up to the Great War, or World War
                        I.<ptr target="#note10" xml:id="nr10" n="10"/> Notably, while children were
                    certainly a part of the intended market, they were not necessarily the only
                    intended audience. Many adults played with miniatures with and without children,
                    and Wells was clearly not writing to an exclusively child audience. The venue in
                    which <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> was published, <emph rend="italic"
                        >Windsor Magazine</emph>, was for “men and women,” and Wells consistently
                    speaks to adults throughout the rulebook. </p>
                <p>The subtitle of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> itself, “A game for Boys
                    from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent
                    sort of girl who likes boys’ games and books,” explicitly highlights the belief
                    that adults (primarily male&#8212;a misconception about gaming that still exists
                    today) could enjoy these games. This subtitle is even more interesting after
                    realizing that Wells’s oldest son, George Philip, was not quite twelve at the
                    time <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> was first published, excluding both
                    of Wells’s children from the audience for <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>
                    despite them being the focus of his earlier <emph rend="italic">Floor
                        Games</emph>.<ptr target="#note11" xml:id="nr11" n="11"/> Moreover, Kimberley
                    Reynolds points out that “there is, in fact, a notable absence of children in
                    the photographs that illustrate <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>”<ptr
                        target="#note12" xml:id="nr12" n="12"/> &#8212;four of the photos do 
                    feature Wells and his opponent, Jerome K. Jerome, giants in comparison to the
                    miniature world they are creating. And Wells was not the only adult literary
                    figure involved in war games. Besides his companion Jerome, we know that Robert
                    Louis Stevenson and others enjoyed playing with miniatures.<ptr target="#note13"
                        xml:id="nr13" n="13"/> Wells even claims to have played war games with
                    various political leaders, including Winston Churchill.<ptr target="#note14"
                        xml:id="nr14" n="14"/>
                </p>
                <p>And girls <emph rend="italic">did</emph> play too. As early as 1826, toy soldiers
                    inspired the Bront&#235; sisters to write the Gendal Saga and the Angria
                    stories. Although the Bront&#235;s surely were an intelligent set of girls,
                    Edith Nesbit proves that women were also involved in a similar kind of play. In
                    1910—before Wells had even begun to serialize <emph rend="italic">The New
                        Machiavelli—</emph>Nesbit published <emph rend="italic">The Magic City</emph>, the
                    story of a girl and boy shrinking in size to enter a mini-city built out of
                    household objects on the playroom floor. Nesbit followed this novel with a book
                    for parents that provided instructions for how adults and children could build
                    their own "magic cities" together. Entitled <emph rend="italic">Wings and the
                        Child</emph>, this book came out the same year as <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph>.<ptr target="#note15" xml:id="nr15" n="15"/> These nearly
                    concurrent publications show the contemporary marketability of instructions for
                    building worlds and wars for both the young and the old. </p>
                <p>In any case, Wells’s war-game rules continue to be considered the most influential
                    rules from the time. This is, no doubt, in part because of Wells’s status as a
                    popular writer and the co-occurring advancement of toy technologies. Many
                    scholars have commented on how Wells’s rulebooks nearly function as advertising
                    for William Britain’s toys. J. R. Sinclair’s illustrations certainly resemble
                    contemporary toy soldier advertisements. In <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph>,
                    at least, Wells directly addresses the toy industry: “And of the war game I
                    must either write volumes or nothing. Some day, perhaps, I will write a great
                    book about the war game and tell of battles and campaigns and strategy and
                    tactics. But this time I set out merely to tell of the ordinary joys of playing
                    with the floor, and to gird improvingly and usefully at toymakers.”<ptr
                        target="#note16" xml:id="nr16" n="16"/> James Opie suggests that Wells’s
                    girding in <emph rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> was successful, as Wells calls
                    for a larger variety of citizen miniatures, something that Britain delivered in
                    1912 with the Civilians Set 168. Opie even goes so far as to “wonder if contact
                    [between Wells and Britain] ensued, and <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>
                    was the result.”<ptr target="#note17" xml:id="nr17" n="17"/> In many ways, Wells
                        <emph rend="italic">was</emph> advertising miniatures; at the time he saw
                    playing war as a practice that might discourage real war, a particularly timely
                    purpose considering Wells published <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> just
                    a year before the start of the First World War. </p>

            <div>
                <head>Wells and War</head>
                <p>What Wells knew as the “Great War” was clearly on his mind as he was writing
                        <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>. He repeatedly juxtaposes his games
                    with reality, even claiming to believe that <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> might function as a deterrent for the “Real Thing.”
                    Specifically, Wells imagines that players of his game would begin to see the
                    horrors and impracticality of real warfare: “I have never yet met in little
                    battle any military gentleman, any captain, major, colonel, general, or eminent
                    commander, who did not presently get into difficulties and confusions among even
                    the elementary rules of the Battle. You have only to play at Little Wars three
                    or four times to realise just what a blundering thing Great War must be.”<ptr
                        target="#note18" xml:id="nr18" n="18"/> His preoccupation with the coming
                    war is perhaps further highlighted by the initial serialization of <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>. In addition to the new chapters and
                    grammatical emendations we mentioned earlier, Wells's most substantial revisions
                    to <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> occur in chapter 4, "Ending With a Sort of
                    Challenge." Wells was more aggressive in the serial, having written:
                    "I have never yet met in little battle any military gentleman, any captain,
                    major, colonel, general, or eminent commander, who wasn't quite easily
                    anticipated, outmanœuvred, and <emph rend="italic">licked</emph> at these
                    miniature exercises."<ptr target="#note19" xml:id="nr19" n="19"/> A few other
                    rewordings follow, often softening Wells's criticism of the incompetency of the
                    military, but the sentiment in both versions remains the same. Thus, Peterson
                    aptly qualifies <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>: “Nominally it describes
                    a game, but it served just as well as a polemic.”<ptr target="#note20"
                        xml:id="nr20" n="20"/></p>
                <p>Wells appears to be reacting to fears about modern warfare between world powers
                    in particular. Much of this fear seems to stem from rapidly evolving weapon
                    technologies. Even by 1909, Wells admitted that “we have over-developed war” in
                    his essay entitled "The Possible Collapse of Civilisation."<ptr target="#note21"
                        xml:id="nr21" n="21"/> In fact, many of his writings foretold the
                    destruction of man through war. And while <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>
                    was his first war “game,” “by the time the world went to war in August
                    1914, H. G. Wells had already fought a goodly number of major wars, most of them
                    global in scope, in his scientific romances, short stories, and essays.”<ptr
                        target="#note22" xml:id="nr22" n="22"/> Wells was incredibly gifted at
                    predicting future war technologies, conceivably making the realities of a
                    fast-approaching war all the more terrifying for him. After all, he imagined
                    what are essentially tanks in <emph rend="italic">The Land Ironclad</emph>
                    (1903), aerial warfare in <emph rend="italic">The War in the Air</emph> (1908),
                    and atomic bombs in <emph rend="italic">The World Set Free</emph> (1914).</p>
                <p>Perhaps his fear is what made playing at war so fascinating to Wells.
                    Peterson and others have pointed out how antiquated Wells’s battle rules are.
                    Unlike real battle, chapter 2 shows how Wells modified his game tirelessly in
                    order to develop a fair form of war. One might say that <emph rend="italic"
                        >Little Wars</emph> even offers up a utopian version of war since it works
                    toward setting up a battle among equals. The little wars staged according to
                    Wells’s rules are not representations of an Imperial Britain against indigenous
                    peoples resisting colonization, nor even are they battles of Waterloo, between
                    two distinct yet Western powers. Instead, <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> can be most accurately understood as a battle between two
                    Englands before modern war technologies.<ptr target="#note23" xml:id="nr23"
                        n="23"/>
                </p>
                <p>At all points, Wells constructs the procedures of his game to indicate the
                    necessary equality between Players A and B. Even in cases where an advantage may
                    be inferred, Wells considers and implements rules to eliminate or mitigate those
                    advantages. Aside from determining the country designer (a privilege Wells also
                    attempts to make more equitable by allowing the other player to choose where
                    their army enters), the mechanics of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> are
                    designed to help eliminate chance: players receive an equal number of units,
                    although they can choose the configuration (more cavalry versus more guns or
                    infantry, etc.), who all obey a mutual set of rules with little difference
                    between the opposing sides. Battle is also reliant on mutual trust; although
                    players can use a curtain to hide their setup, much of the game is fought in
                    the open and each player is responsible for keeping track of time during their
                    opponent’s turn. </p>
                <p>This egalitarian and trustful approach to warfare reflects Wells’s
                    romanticization of a simpler time within his rules. Peterson notes that <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> recalls “a romantic era of warfare, that of
                    a century before: a time when two uniformed armies in orderly columns conducted
                    the business of war under a common law of arms, in a bounded arena far from
                        civilians.”<ptr target="#note24" xml:id="nr24" n="24"/> Compared to the
                    threat of increasingly technological warfare, Wells’s wars are tame, simple, and
                    clean. Attacks rely almost completely on the aimed cannon fire or capture; until
                    the appendix where Wells and Colonel Mark Sykes adapt the rules of <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> to be more effective as a training
                    mechanism, Wells does not make any instructions for arming the soldiers with
                    rifles. In fact, “in the <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> systems infantry
                    and cavalry effectively fight in melee range,”<ptr target="#note25"
                        xml:id="nr25" n="25"/> an anachronistic decision that reflects Wells’s
                    anxieties about and dismissal of a more modern, technologically advanced form of
                    warfare.</p>
                <p>And yet, Wells's desire for <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> to function as
                    a sort of substitution for war, while educating and providing entertainment,
                    necessitates that the little wars reflect, in some way, the complexities and
                    realities of a real war. Referencing proponents of war, Wells believed that “my
                    game is just as good as their game, and saner by reason of its size. Here is
                    War, done down to rational proportions, and yet out of the way of mankind.”<ptr
                        target="#note26" xml:id="nr26" n="26"/> Despite the possible annoyance of
                    toy war spilling out into the staircase,<ptr target="#note27" xml:id="nr27"
                        n="27"/> little wars were abstracted from reality. The game allowed for more
                    control than the looming Great War; it granted the players a feeling of agency
                    while also removing war simulation from any real world: “The miniature . . .
                    presents a diminutive, and thereby manipulatable, version of experience, a
                    version which is domesticated and protected from contamination. It marks the
                    pure body, the inorganic body of the machine and its repetition of a death that
                    is thereby not a death.”<ptr target="#note28" xml:id="nr28" n="28"/> Wells continuously reminds the
                    reader that, lacking any
                    visceral ends and capable of repeated play, these little toy soldiers and their little wars do not replicate
                    reality, even if they satisfy a desire for violence. Wells challenges the
                    realities of war through the very ability to reenact and reimagine battles and
                    scenery again and again. This combined with antiquated weapon technology allows
                    the warfare in <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> to be relatively harmless
                    compared to the “Real Thing.” </p>
                <p>Famous for his “Imaginative Romances” and articles of social commentary that
                   often forebode man’s destruction at the hands of increasingly
                    dangerous weapons, Wells unsurprisingly uses <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> to once more expound his beliefs: <quote>And if I might for a
                        moment trumpet! How much better is this amiable miniature than the Real
                        Thing! . . . Here is the premeditation, the thrill, the strain of
                        accumulating victory or disaster&#8212;and no smashed nor sanguinary bodies,
                        no shattered fine buildings nor devastated country sides, no petty
                        cruelties, none of that awful universal boredom and embitterment, that
                        tiresome delay or stoppage or embarrassment of every gracious bold, sweet,
                        and charming thing, that we who are old enough to remember a real modern war
                        know to be the reality of belligerence.<ptr target="#note29" xml:id="nr29"
                            n="29"/></quote>It is this idea of a modern war that Wells fears and
                    tries to leave out of his rulebook, an interesting but conscious choice for
                    someone who regularly incorporated technology into his writings. Asimov would
                    later write in his foreword to <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>, “There is
                    an air of glamor and excitement about war&#8212;past wars, that is, that one
                    need not actually live through. The dangers and the daring and the gallant
                    defeats and the clever stratagems and the final triumph&#8212;what can replace
                    it? In the absence of reality, there is the driving desire to find a
                        substitute.”<ptr target="#note30" xml:id="nr30" n="30"/> With such a gifted
                    imagination, perhaps in miniatures Wells finally found a way to create a utopian
                    version of war that (toy) technology allowed for rather than made impossible. </p>
                <p>However, throughout his life Wells was conflicted about war games. While in <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> Wells imagines his games as “a homeopathic
                    remedy for the imaginative strategist,”<ptr target="#note31" xml:id="nr31"
                        n="32"/> twenty-one years later in his autobiography he laments how the current
                    educational system glamorizes war and socializes children to desire to
                    reconstruct it: “I think there is no natural bias towards bloodshed in
                    imaginative youngsters, but the only vivid and inspiring things that history fed
                    me with were campaigns and conquests.”<ptr target="#note32" xml:id="nr32" n="32"
                    /> He claims that his pre-World War I self saw war games as an outlet, but the
                    beginning of the “Great War” affected his outlook: “Up to 1914, I found a lively
                    interest in playing a war game, with toy soldiers and guns, that recalled a
                    peculiar quality and pleasure of those early reveries.”<ptr target="#note33"
                        xml:id="nr33" n="33"/> In fact, Wells seems to have come to the belief that
                    these games and the culture that produced them were actually dangerous as
                    opposed to an outlet.<ptr target="#note34" xml:id="nr34" n="34"/> He bemoans
                    that “men in responsible positions” such as Winston Churchill, had imaginations
                    “built upon a similar framework” causing them to remain “puerile in their
                    political outlook.”<ptr target="#note35" xml:id="nr35" n="35"/> Instead, Wells
                    believed he had moved beyond his little wars: “I like to think I grew up out of
                    that stage somewhere between 1916 and 1920 and began to think about war as a

                    something about war games attracted Wells. He certainly continued to include
                    depictions of war games in his works, from the <emph rend="italic">kriegspiel</emph> in <emph rend="italic"
                        >The World Set Free</emph> (1914) to toy soldiers in <emph rend="italic">Joan
                        and Peter</emph> (1918). Far from Wells growing out of "that stage," Morgan Fritz
                    even argues that we can see the same sort of desire for control over miniatures
                    in Wells's fiction.<ptr target="#note37" xml:id="nr37" n="37"/> Regardless of
                    what Wells actually felt about war games, it was a motif he kept
                    returning to, and his rules would go on to affect the future of the genre.</p>

                <head><emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> and Influence</head>
                <p>Despite Wells recanting his belief that little wars could help curtail great
                    ones, many other war gamers have continued to see play as an outlet for violence.
                    In his foreword to a 2004 edition of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>,
                    tabletop gaming icon Gary Gygax admits to defending war gaming with an argument
                    very similar to Wells’s claim in <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>; Gygax
                    explains that “miniature soldiers leave no widows or orphans, and that if more
                    people were busy fighting little wars, they might not be involved in fighting
                    big ones.”<ptr target="#note38" xml:id="nr38" n="38"/> But Gygax found far more
                    inspiration in Wells than a stance on the importance of war gaming; Gygax praises
                    Wells’s game for its formative role in the development of his tabletop games:
                            <quote><emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> influenced my development
                        of both the <emph rend="italic">Chainmail</emph> miniatures rules and the
                            <emph rend="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</emph> fantasy roleplaying
                        game. For example, it established the concept of a burst radius for cannon
                        rounds, an idea that was translated into both the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Chainmail</emph> catapult missile diameters and the areas of effect for
                        Fireballs in D&amp;D.<ptr target="#note39" xml:id="nr39" n="39"/></quote>By
                    declaring the adaptation of Wells’s rules for his own works, Gygax reveals a piece of the
                    transmission history of common game mechanics. Burst Radius and Area of Effect
                    have proliferated beyond tabletop gaming into the digital world of video games
                    by way of <emph rend="italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</emph>, and have become
                    colloquialized into the common acronym AoE. Examples of the reliance on the
                    concept of AoE are numerous: <emph rend="italic"
                        >World of Warcraft</emph>, <emph rend="italic">Final Fantasy Tactics</emph>,
                    and <emph rend="italic">Dragon Age</emph> are popular and prime examples of the
                    simple application of Euclidean geometry as Wells prescribes it for
                    operationalizing cannon fire or any analogous mechanism a game may desire to
                    express. How far the concept has come from lengths of string and a spring-loaded
                        toy!<ptr target="#note40" xml:id="nr40" n="40"/></p>
                <p>We mention Gygax not to divert interest from how innovative and interesting <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> is in and of itself, but to include an
                    additional motive for its study and its relevance to game studies in particular.
                    The passage above shows how the theory of transmission, well known to textual
                    scholars and editors, can be seen as an overt force that works in a unique way
                    when compared to traditional textual transmission. The way a concept such as a
                    rule carries through time and through different works by different authors
                    highlights how games, although narratives in their own right, are also just as
                    much texts in a physical and phenomenological sense, capable of being adapted
                    and interpreted (as we do in the streamlined rules), but also borrowed from,
                    modernized, and, for lack of a better phrase, <emph rend="italic">played
                        with</emph>. </p>
                <p><emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> is also special because of the previously
                    mentioned “development diary” in chapter 2. This chapter traces Wells’s
                    journey in not only creating but revising the rules of <emph rend="italic"
                        >Little Wars</emph>; a book of rules was already revolutionary at the time,
                    but that he described his process shows what a careful and thoughtful game
                    designer Wells was. Not only can we view Wells’s rulebook in terms of what it
                    has contributed to the games that have come after it, but also we are rewarded when <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> points back to itself, investing space in
                    its own process of creation and refinement as a game worth carrying forward.

                <head>Editorial Statement</head>
                <p>Our transcription is based on the first edition of <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph>, published by Frank Palmer in 1913. We removed extra spacing
                    around punctuation to make the text more readable but otherwise maintained
                    Wells’s grammar and spelling. While <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> first
                    appeared in <emph rend="italic">Windsor Magazine</emph>, the magazine notes that
                    Palmer maintains the copyright. Since Palmer had already released <emph
                        rend="italic">Floor Games</emph> with marginal illustrations&#8212;in fact,
                    with marginal illustrations that Wells mentioned within the body of his
                    text&#8212;we can assume that once again Palmer and Wells imagined a publication
                    with similar marginalia. Because of this, we felt it particularly important to
                    create a digital edition that allowed readers to see <emph rend="italic">Little
                        Wars</emph> in book form, something many (unedited) digital editions have
                    failed to do. </p>
                <p>In addition to notes that help contextualize the book or provide clarification,
                    we have also noted possible issues and inconsistencies within the rules
                    themselves. We have provided emendations to these issues in our streamlined
                    rules, which, although derived from Wells’s, are simplified in order to make the
                    game more accessible and playable. These streamlined rules are meant to
                    encourage play, but they are also the product of an interpretive process of clarifying
                    Wells’s rules. Those who wish to adopt and play <emph
                        rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> may review our notes in the body of the
                    text to determine whether or not they agree with the decisions we have made. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>XML</head>
                <p>Our XML is based on the TEI P5 guidelines. To our knowledge, there have not been published or extended discussions of how TEI may be used to encode games and rules. Thus, many of our decisions were made through a combination of both intuition and trial and error. Our decisions are based on how best to treat the
                    rules in <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> in a way that represents Wells’s organizational structure:
                    he created divisions for his instructions (for instance, combat would be one
                    division and movement another) and then used lists to organize specifications.
                    Since the text exists as a means of guiding play, we felt that encoding the
                    rules helped to accentuate the game itself as the core of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>, and the rules'
                    representation as discrete parts of the text formed the basis for our encoding
                    decisions. </p>
                <p>Each set of rules (as Wells groups them) are enclosed by &lt;div&gt; elements and
                    represented by &lt;list&gt; with the @type attribute to declare the purpose
                    (that is, usually, “instructions”) of the list. In some cases, where Wells
                    further subdivides his rules (e.g., a rule 3 contains both rules 3a and 3b),
                    &lt;list&gt; is used within &lt;item&gt; as well. The streamlined rules also
                    follow the same standards for consistency, although they were written to be less
                    complicated, in terms of format, than Wells’s writing.</p>
                <p>In addition to the rules, our XML also attempts to be faithful to Wells’s own
                    representation of the text and the structure of the book. To that extent, we
                    encoded the bibliographical properties of the text, such as the page breaks or
                    page signatures (marked by the &lt;fw&gt; tag) to show the book's physical
                    composition. We have included &lt;graphic&gt; elements that point to the
                    photographic inserts. While these inserts disrupt the body of the text, the
                    photographs are valuable in that they help to clarify Wells’s descriptions of
                    battle and highlight <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> as a means of
                    participatory play.</p>
