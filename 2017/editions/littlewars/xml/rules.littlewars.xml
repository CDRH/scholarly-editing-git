                <head>Streamlined Rules</head>
                <p>In this section, we have attempted to streamline the rules presented in <emph
                    rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>. Our hopes are that this rule list will offer a better option for reference should one desire to play <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>, as it condenses Wells’s sometimes verbose and disorganized instructions. In some sections, Wells’s rules are
                    unclear or in need of further explanation. This is most apparent in the rules
                    for the <emph rend="italic">mêlée</emph>, where some questions arise about
                    which player may act first, or about how to make decisions regarding the loss of units. We have added notes to <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph>
                    where unclear moments occur, and the streamlined rules presented here attempt to
                    resolve these complications.</p>
                <p> We would like to extend credit to Jason Fairfield, who did the original pass on
                    the rules of <emph rend="italic">Little Wars</emph> for us and wrote what formed
                    the basis of the streamlined rules.</p>

                    <head><label>1.1</label> The Units</head>
                    <item>There are two types of units: infantry and cavalry. Infantry may move up
                        to 1 foot, while cavalry may move up to 2 feet. Other than movement speed,
                        infantry and cavalry follow the same rules.</item>
                    <item>A space of 1/16 of an inch should be kept between all units and terrain. A
                        unit may never be placed inside any part of the battlefield, including
                        houses.</item>
                    <item>When a unit moves within ⅛ of an inch of an enemy unit, it must stop its
                        movement and is considered in <emph rend="italic">contact</emph> with the
                        enemy unit.</item>
                    <item>If a unit is not within one move of at least half of the remaining
                        friendly units, it is considered <emph rend="italic">isolated</emph>.</item>
                    <item>Units may retreat from battle by crossing their own back line. They are
                        removed from play, but may still be counted as alive and uncaptured when
                        determining points for the battle.</item>
                    <item>Units may be captured by the enemy and made <emph rend="italic"
                            >prisoners</emph>. <list>
                            <item><emph rend="italic">Prisoners</emph> may not participate in <emph

                                do not count when determining whether or not a cannon is <emph
                                    rend="italic">active</emph> or captured.</item>
                            <item>One friendly unit may escort up to seven enemy <emph rend="italic"
                                    >prisoners</emph> within 6 inches of it.</item>
                            <item>Escorted <emph rend="italic">prisoners</emph> are moved by the
                                opposing player on their turn, but unescorted <emph rend="italic"
                                    >prisoners</emph> may be moved normally by their player. </item>
                            <item>A unit is no longer considered a <emph rend="italic"
                                    >prisoner</emph> if it makes it to its friendly back line. It is
                                removed from the battlefield if it is taken to the enemy back line.
                                These changes are made during the Aftermath stage of a player’s
                                turn.</item>

                    <item>Require at least four friendly units within 6 inches to be considered <emph

                    <item>Can either be moved or fired in the same turn, not both.</item>
                    <item>May not be fired during the first turn of the game.</item>
                    <item>Can fire up to four shots during a turn. After firing its last shot, the
                        cannon cannot be aimed or adjusted, and one friendly unit within 6 inches
                        must be placed on each side of the cannon near the wheels. </item>
                    <item>When being moved, at least four units who are with the cannon must move up
                        with it to its new position, and these units must be placed within 6
                        inches of the cannon's new position. The cannon may move the speed of the four
                        fastest units moving with it. The muzzle of the cannon must point backward
                        toward the direction it came from.</item>
                    <item>A shot from a cannon kills the first unit it touches as well as any other
                        unit that falls because of it. A unit is considered killed that cannot stand
                        on its own and would fall if unsupported after a shot. </item>
                    <item>While firing, cannons may be rotated around the middle point of its wheel
                        axle to take aim. Any friendly units within 6 inches may be laid down to
                        allow the gun to fire unobstructed.</item>

                    <item>Before playing, the players will need to set up the battlefield and the
                        forces that will fight upon it. The battlefield is also formally called "the
                        Country."</item>
                    <item>Ensure that each player has a way of measuring distances in inches and
                        feet. Two pieces of string, one measuring 2 feet and the other 6 inches,
                        will suffice.</item>
                    <item>Each player must determine the composition of their forces between
                        infantry, cavalry, and cannons. In a standard game each side's forces
                        have a total value of 150 points, though larger or smaller battles may be
                        fought as well. Infantry are 1 point, cavalry are 1½ points, and cannons
                        are 10 points.</item>
                    <item>Players will flip a coin to decide who shall arrange the Country. The
                        winner may place obstacles and cover to represent houses, trees, hills, etc.,
                        anywhere they wish over the battlefield. If any pieces of the Country are
                        bumped or moved during the turn, they must be placed back to their original
                        position immediately. </item>
                    <item>The player who did not arrange the Country will choose which side they
                        will fight from, determining which end of the battlefield will be their back
                        line.</item>

                    <item>Once the players have chosen their forces and arranged the Country, it is
                        time for them to set up their armies and prepare for battle. The following
                        steps outline this process: <list rend="bulleted">

                            <item>The first player will arrange their forces along their back line.
                                Units not placed on the back line must be placed as close as
                                possible to it, and the distance moved on their first turn must be measured as if
                                they started on the back line. The second player will then do the
                                same. <list rend="bulleted">
                                    <item>Alternately, if some way of hiding the deployments can be

                                        then both sides may deploy their forces at the same time.
                                        After both sides have finished, the deployments are revealed
                                        and the players begin taking turns, starting with the first

                    <item>A player’s turn will consist of several phases: Command, Hand-to-Hand
                        Fighting, and the Aftermath. These phases are outlined below. These phases
                        must be resolved in order. After the Aftermath stage of a player’s turn has
                        finished, the next player will start the Command phase of their turn. </item>
                    <item><label>2.3.1 Command.</label> In this phase, the player will move their
                        cannons and units across the battlefield as well as fire their cannons. This
                        phase is timed; the length of time allowed is determined by the size of the original
                        forces as follows: 1 minute for every 30 units and 1 minute for each cannon.
                        Warnings should be given at 2 minutes, 1 minute, and 30 seconds. A player
                        may not interact with any cannon or unit until the timer starts and must
                        immediately stop once the timer expires. Every cannon and unit may be
                        activated during this phase as the rules and time permits. <list

                                players determine which cannons are currently <emph rend="italic"
                                    >active</emph> for each force. If a cannon has no friendly units,
                                and if it has at least four enemy units within 6 inches that
                                have crossed the cannon’s wheel axis, that cannon is captured and is
                                considered <emph rend="italic">active</emph> for the enemy force. The
                                enemy player may use this cannon as if it were part of their force
                                on their next turn.</item>
                            <item><label>Determine Status of Prisoners.</label> With units moving
                                across the battlefield and being killed, the status of <emph
                                    rend="italic">prisoners</emph> may have changed. During this
                                step, both players determine which of their captured <emph

                                    <emph rend="italic">prisoners</emph> are moved by the opposing

                                    >prisoners</emph> may be moved normally by the player to whom

                    <item><label>3.1 Fight to the Finish.</label> This is the standard way to play
                        the game. The objective is to kill, capture, or drive back the entirety of
                        your enemy’s forces. Both sides continue to fight until either all units of
                        one side retreat, are killed or captured, or both sides are reduced to below 15
                        units (which results in a draw).</item>
                    <item><label>3.2 The Blow at the Rear.</label> The objective of this game mode
                        is to be the first player to get at least three of their units to the
                        opponent’s back line. At this point, the defeated player has suffered a
                        strategic loss and is allowed six turns to retreat as many units as possible
                        over their back line. The victor captures any units that have not retreated
                        after the sixth turn. This game mode is designed for a smaller and more
                        constrained Country and is much shorter than the Fight to the Finish mode. </item>
                    <item><label>3.3 Defensive.</label> In this game mode, one player is designated
                        as the defender while the other is the attacker. The objective for the
                        attacker is to get one-fourth of their original units to the defender’s back line,
                        while the defender must prevent this. The defender must have a force that is
                        two-thirds as strong as the attacker's. After setting up the Country, the player who
                        chooses their side will become the defender. The defender will become first
                        player (without a coin flip) and may deploy their units anywhere on their
                        side, as long as they are not within one move of the center of the
                        battlefield. The attacker will then deploy their units, which may be within
                        one move of their own back line. The defender may ignore the restriction on
                        cannons firing on the first turn and may open fire immediately.</item>
                    <item><label>3.4 Campaign.</label> Several battles may be strung together to
                        create a campaign. Players will score points at the end of each battle
                        adding them up until an ultimate victor prevails. All three types of battles
                        may be fought in any combination during a campaign. Once a battle is over,
                        points are awarded to each side as follows: <list rend="bulleted">
                            <item>The winning side gains 100 points (each side gets 50 points on a
                                draw).</item>
                            <item>Both players gain points for the value of each of their remaining
                                units that are alive and not captured. Players get 1 point for
                                infantry, 1½ points for cavalry, and 10 points for each cannon they
                                currently control or are in a position to take (meaning if a cannon would be considered <emph rend="italic">active</emph> during a player’s next turn).</item>
                            <item>Both players gain ½ point for any prisoners under their control and ½ point for
                                any of their own soldiers held prisoner by the enemy. </item>
                        </list> Depending on the number of games desired in the campaign, a point
                        value is determined (usually 200, 300, or 400). At the end of any battle
                        where a player’s new point total would exceed their opponent’s total by this
                        amount, that player has won the campaign. </item>

                    Do-it-yourself options exist for creating spring-loaded cannons that function
