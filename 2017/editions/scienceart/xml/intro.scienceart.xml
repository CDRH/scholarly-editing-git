                <head>Introduction</head>
            <byline>by Rebecca Nesvet</byline>
                <p>On 24 July, 1820, an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">London Morning
                        Post</hi> announced “The Triumph of Mechanism.” In an exhibition room in the
                    Western Exchange, Bond Street, a man&#8211;shaped machine called “PROSOPOGRAPHUS, the
                    AUTOMATON ARTIST” was reportedly drawing perfect silhouettes of astonished
                    visitors and strategically placed portrait busts. European spectators had seen
                    other automata write their inventor’s name, play music, or make sounds, but
                    Prosopographus was different. This automaton’s output seemed neither
                    predetermined by its inventor nor limited to a narrow range of options. “[T]he
                    only Automaton in the world that takes Likenesses,” Prosopographus could
                    complete “a Profile Likeness in one minute.”<ptr target="#note1" xml:id="nr1"
                        n="1"/> By 1825, the advertising presented Prosopographus as an existential
                    threat to the human artist. An ad placed in the <hi rend="italic">The Theatrical
                        Observer and Daily Bills of the Play</hi> claimed that the “Automaton Artist
                    [...] draws Likenesses with more certainty,” or accuracy, “than is in the power
                    of the living hand to execute.”<ptr target="#note2" xml:id="nr2" n="2"/></p>
                <p>These ads played upon widespread fears. In 1815, during the Luddite rebellion
                    against the he imposition of labor&#8211;saving machines upon the weaving
                    industry, the utopian reformer Robert Owen had condemned the emerging factory
                    economy and the machines that made it possible. The son&#8211;in&#8211;law of a
                    Scottish industrialist, Owen saw firsthand the effects of the “manufacturing
                    system” upon the children who constituted much of his
                    father&#8211;in&#8211;law’s workforce. “Is it to be imagined,” Owen asked, “that
                    the British Government will ever put the chance of a trivial pecuniary gain of a
                    few, in competition with the solid welfare of so many millions of human
                        beings?”<ptr target="#note3" xml:id="nr3" n="3"/> The answer was
                    affirmative. The Luddites were suppressed, and Prosopographus warned
                    middle&#8211;class Londoners that even skilled artists could find themselves
                    replaced by self&#8211;acting machines.</p>
                <p>A similar warning is issued in an obscure playscript of 1820. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art, A Farce, in Two Acts</hi> concerns a young London lawyer,
                    Jack Freeman, who falls in love with Maria, the ward of an inventor of automata,
                    Peter Patent. This industrial&#8211;age Pantalone intends to save the British
                    nation a great deal of money by replacing various entire professions with his
                    patent automata. Freeman gains access to Patent’s home by masquerading as an
                    automaton, in a performance choreographed by his friend Dick Lobby, another
                    unscrupulous lawyer. When Lobby brings the pseudo&#8211;automaton to Patent, the
                    confusion of machine with human creates comic mayhem, and forces Patent to
                    question his previous dismissal of the human in favor of the machine. Meanwhile,
                    the denouément hints that Freeman is not in fact a self&#8211;acting individual,
                    or free man, but a part of a social machine, for he has unwittingly pursued
                    Maria in accordance with a plan designed by others.</p>
                <p>Written by the critically neglected working&#8211;class novelist, poet, and
                    engraver Malcolm Rymer (ca. 1775&#8211;1835), <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi> is here reprinted for the first time since the nineteenth century.
                    It deserves scholarly attention not only for its commentary on the Industrial
                    Revolution, but for its “second story”: that of the editor who facilitated its
                    initial publication, the author’s son James Malcolm Rymer (1814&#8211;84). In
                    the 1840s&#8211;60s, James Malcolm Rymer achieved considerable literary success
                    by prolifically penning “penny bloods,” or cheap fiction serials targeting
                    working&#8211;class readers. His bloods included the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dracula</hi> precursor <hi rend="italic">Varney, the Vampyre; or, the Feast
                        of Blood</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls; or, the Barber of
                        Fleet&#8211;street</hi>, the earliest tale of the fictional entrepreneur,
                    machine&#8211;inventor, murderer, and early food&#8211;processing magnate
                    Sweeney Todd.<ptr target="#note4" xml:id="nr4" n="4"/> Before these triumphs,
                    James Malcolm Rymer published his late father’s play <hi rend="italic">Science
                        and Art,</hi> without attribution, in the August, 1842 fifth and final
                    number of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>.<ptr target="#note5"
                        xml:id="nr5" n="5"/> As I will show, the play was an important text in James
                    Malcolm Rymer’s literary career and in the group output of his intergenerational
                    literary family, not least because it connects Romantic and Victorian&#8211;era
                    political themes and intriguingly anticipates key aspects of <hi rend="italic"
                        >The String of Pearls</hi> that reverberate throughout the Sweeney Todd
                    mythos. Quite possibly, the most transformative gift Malcolm Rymer gave his son
                    was his rage against the machines.</p>

            <div>
                <head>“By Mr. M. Rymer&#8212;1820”</head>
                <p>  </p></div>
            <div>
                <p>It has very recently become possible to identify Malcolm Rymer as the author of
                        <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> and the composition date as 1820. The
                    play was unattributed and undated until October 2016, when the Rare Books
                    Collection, Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, University of North
                    Carolina, Chapel Hill acquired from the London antiquarian book dealer Jarndyce
                    and Company a partial copy of the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Magazine</hi>, edited by James Malcolm Rymer. This volume contains four
                    numbers of the magazine, dated May through August 1842. The April number is
                    missing. According to Jarndyce cataloguer and penny bloods scholar Helen R.
                    Smith, this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> had been in
                    James Malcolm Rymer’s possession. Some of its contents bear handwritten
                    corrections. Rymer signed a theatre review, of the William Macready vehicle
                    “Acis and Galatea” (13) and is also identified in handwriting as the poet of
                    “Love’s Fables,” which the printed text attributes to “George Hillier Fantome,”
                    a pseudonym that combines the name of the publisher George Hillier
                    (1815&#8211;66) with the French word for ghost (109).<ptr target="#note6"
                        xml:id="nr6" n="6"/> A handwritten note at the top of the first page of <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art </hi> reads “By Mr. M. Rymer&#8212;1820”
                    (190). I propose that this author is Malcolm Rymer. As I have shown in a
                    contribution to <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> (forthcoming 2017),
                    Malcolm Rymer, born in Edinburgh, was active in the London literary community of
                    the early nineteenth century. He used the abbreviation “Mr. Rymer” for the
                    bylines of two poems he published in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine</hi>
                    in 1815 and 1818, and on the title&#8211;page of his 1806 novel <hi
                        rend="italic">The Spaniard, or the Pride of Birth, A Tale</hi>, he styled
                    himself “M. Rymer.” As he was the only male imaginative writer called “M. Rymer”
                    who was active during the Regency or the early Victorian era, it is highly
                    unlikely that a “Mr. M. Rymer” published by Malcolm Rymer’s son could be anybody
                        else.<ptr target="#note7" xml:id="nr7" n="7"/></p>
                <p>The manuscript attribution to Malcolm Rymer is likely accurate, because it
                    apparently was written by his son. The hand differs significantly from James
                    Malcolm Rymer’s signature on the review of “Acis and Galatea,” but it closely
                    resembles another of his signatures, that with which he solemnized his marriage
                    to Caroline Huttly in the St. James, Clerkenwell parish record on 27 April,
                        1839.<ptr target="#note8" xml:id="nr8" n="8"/> This signature and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> inscription share similar capital and
                    lowercase <hi rend="italic">m</hi>’s and large, loose lowercase <hi
                        rend="italic">er</hi>’s that appear nearly like uppercase letters. A
                    strikethrough nearly bisects at least some of the letters horizontally in both
                    examples. This evidence combined with James Malcolm Rymer’s known connection to
                    the annotated copy of his magazine seems most likely that the attribution is his
                    holograph annotation.</p>
               
                <p>Could <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> have actually been written in the
                    1840s by James Malcolm Rymer and misattributed to his father? This is
                    improbable, as the play seems indeed to have been written in 1820, when James
                    Malcolm Rymer was only six years old. <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    references topical events of 1820. Prosopographus was on display then. The play
                    also includes a joke about “the dissolution of Parliament” (192). One such
                    dissolution occurred in February 1820, subsequent to the death of King George
                    III in the month before. During the 1840s, however, Parliament was only
                    dissolved in June 1841 (an entire year before the play’s publication) and 1847. </p>
                <p>A recurring topical joke involves Lobby’s claim that Patent, the
                    London&#8211;based inventor of automata, is famous in Asia and particularly
                    celebrated in China. This would have made sense in the early years of the
                    nineteenth century but not the 1840s because in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth century, London was the global export center for automata, largely on
                    account of the activity of a few automaton&#8211;makers, including James Cox and
                    the Swiss expatriates Henri&#8211;Louis Jaquet&#8211;Droz and his foster brother
                    Frédéric Leschot. Although some Jaquet&#8211;Droz&#8211;Leschot wares were
                    produced in their London workshop and some in Switzerland, Leschot confessed
                    that eventually, all new ones were “engraved as though [made] in England,
                    because it is the general opinion that every thing of this kind [automata] made
                    in that country is of better workmanship” (132).<ptr target="#note9"
                        xml:id="nr9" n="9"/> It was also a common belief that the most zealous
                    appreciators of such things were Chinese. In the 1770s&#8211;90s, the Qianlong
                    Emperor (d. 1799) was a frequent client of this community of artisans. He became
                    famous in Europe for his “apparently insatiable” desire for automata and other
                    mechanical “toys” (318).<ptr target="#note10" xml:id="nr10" n="10"/> Long before
                    1842, the deaths of the Qianlong Emperor and the inventors here named had
                    evaporated this international trade network.</p>
                <p>Additional circumstantial evidence that <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    dates to the early nineteenth century is the reference to “those who march into
                    the field at the arbitrary pleasure of a despot.” In 1820, Napoléon’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Grande Armée</hi> was a vivid living memory, but in 1842,
                    Britain demonized no singular martial despot. Also, the elderly Patent seems
                    more likely to have been a child of the eighteenth century than the nineteenth,
                    as he wears a wig long enough to appear to be caught up by the fake “automaton”
                    (197). The days of elaborate wig&#8211;wearing among men outside the legal
                    profession were much closer to 1820 than 1842. An old man in 1820, as Patent is,
                    could be accustomed to wigs; not so a Victorian. These details suggest that <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> was more likely composed in 1820, as the
                    inscription claims, than in 1842. </p>

            <head>“Those Self&#8211;Moving Machines”</head>
                <p>Malcolm Rymer seems to have been concerned throughout his career about conflicts
                    between man and machine, and science and art. His novel <hi rend="italic">The
                        Spaniard</hi> shows an industrious, honest sixteenth&#8211;century Madrid
                    barber persecuted by the Inquisition. Temperamentally unsuited to the tonsorial
                    trade on account of his aversion to shedding blood or causing pain, Pedrosa de
                    Leandrez eventually finds refuge in a more liberal country: either “England or
                    Holland” (193), the third&#8211;person omniscient narrator noncomittally
                    concludes. A closer look at this tale reveals a timely political agenda. In a
                    significant departure from its source, Richard Cumberland’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >The History of Nicolas Pedrosa</hi> (1798),<hi rend="italic">The
                        Spaniard</hi> pits a feeling artisan against the theory&#8211;driven
                    proverbial machine of the Inquisition, with its literal instruments of torture,
                    suggesting a criticism of the nascent Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p> In <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>, Malcolm Rymer more clearly represents
                    conflict between mechanical and artisanal ingenuity. “One would imagine that
                    [Patent] thought nothing right in this world, as his invention,” or ingenuity,
                    “is continually on the rack to make it better,” Lobby says. “I don’t know how
                    many machines he has invented,” nor “how many schemes he has proposed for the
                    good of the public” (192). In practice, Patent’s “machines” and “schemes” seem
                    unlikely to improve most people’s lives. Instead, they threaten human labor,
                    dignity, thought, and creativity. The first example of Patent’s ingenuity that
                    the play reveals is a nightmare&#8211;vision of labor disenfranchisement and
                    industrial warfare. In the first scene, Lobby tells Freeman that Patent:
                        <quote>[...] not long ago [...] published proposals for an automaton
                        manufactory, in which he explained the variety of uses those self–moving
                        machines might be put to, and what an immense saving of expense to the
                        nation to employ them. In the first place he contended, that the business of
                        an army, according to the system of modern tactics, might as well be managed
                        by automatons as real soldiers; this would be a wonderful saving, as it
                        would render [...] unnecessary almost the whole host of army agents, army
                        contractors, and barrack masters. (193)</quote>In this monologue, Lobby
                    concedes that an automaton army would save lives, as its soldiers would not die
                    and could be “repaired” (193). However, Patent’s rhetoric is primarily economic.
                    He rejoices in the “saving of expense to the nation,” the “wonderful saving,”
                    and is not concerned for the livelihoods of the “whole host” of men rendered
                    “unnecessary” by his innovation.</p>
                <p>Patent’s subsequent scheme attacks the livelihood of members of an even more
                    deeply revered Regency institution, the Royal Navy. “When Old Patent went down
                    to the fleet at <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName> to publish his proposals, our
                    brave tars [sailors] would have him thrown overboard for a a rascal who wanted
                    the enemy to get all the fighting to themselves.” Patent then tries to market
                    his automata to “a few wealthy noblemen [...] who told him that if he could
                    conceive to make them say aye and nay, they would probably take a dozen or two,
                    as they might have use for them upon the dissolution of Parliament” (192). In
                    other words, the aristocracy wants automated voters, whom they could control
                    more easily than the already small and privileged pre&#8211;Reform electorate.
                    This anecdote suggests that Patent’s automata cannot improve society, so long as
                    the power to commission, purchase, and operate them remains with those who
                    resist humane reform. </p>
                <p>Malcolm Rymer reinforces this idea by making Patent wrest technological power
                    away from the upper class, although only for a moment. Rymer’s lawyer characters
                    are unconcerned about Patent’s disruptive potential until they realize that his
                    inventions could threaten their own livelihoods. When Patent tells his friend,
                    Freeman’s lawyer uncle (“Old Freeman”), that he intends to develop a “scheme” to
                    settle law cases “without delay or expense,” thereby making lawyers unnecessary,
                    Old Freeman erupts in self&#8211;concerned outrage. “What? where would be the
                    traffic, if all mankind were to settle their disputes themselves? I say, where
                    would be the cash?” (202). Lawyers would need to become Luddites were the
                    professions to become the targets of industrial improvement. </p>
                <p>The play’s comic resolution implies that mechanical innovation is not inherently
                    evil and that the boundary between human and machine is quite hazy. Freeman and
                    his uncle each don the automaton costume and, by the art of play&#8211;acting,
                    persuade Patent that they are the wondrous automaton. Here, therefore, art
                    triumphs over mechanical genius. When the ruse is exposed, Patent happily
                    accepts his ward’s marriage to Freeman, as it is the exact match he had intended
                    for her. This resolution uncomfortably implies that the rebellious young <hi
                        rend="italic">innamorati</hi> in fact behave as their elders had designed,
                    like machines. As the characters commemorate the engagement by dancing, Patent
                    offers to accompany them on his “newly invented hurdy&#8211;gurdy” (207), a
                    traditional Welsh musical instrument that contains a wheel mechanism reminiscent
                    of clockwork. While Patent must learn the pseudo&#8211;automaton’s
                    secret&#8212;that “the most perfect machine the world ever saw” (202) is the
                    human being&#8212;he is able to use his powers of invention to celebrate
                    love&#8212;which is to say, to celebrate the appreciation of two humans for each
                    other, above all other living and nonliving machines.</p>

                <p>Who, if anyone, was expected to perform <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>,
                    and what was its target audience? Malcolm Rymer appears to have designed <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> for domestic consumption, not
                    professional performance. It seems never to have been produced in the commercial
                    theatre, as journalism from 1819&#8211;60 records no notices for any public
                    performance. However, Regency Britain had a culture of home theatricals, such as
                    those described in Austen’s novel Mansfield Park (1814). <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art</hi> appears suited by design to this performance mode. The
                    specified settings are all either vague and featureless or domestic. For
                    instance, the first scene takes place in the high&#8211;living Freeman’s
                    “lodgings at the Temple.” This impressive landmark is represented by merely a
                    “two chairs and [a] table” (190). Likewise, Freeman meets Maria at the Opera at
                    Covent Garden, but we do not see this momentous meeting. Instead, it is
                    described in retrospect in Freeman’s dialogue with his servant Tom. </p>
                <p>The play’s depiction of Patent’s premises also suggests authorial acquiescence to
                    the limitations of domestic theatricals. The home of an eccentric inventor of
                    anthropomorphic automata would seem ripe for scenographic creativity. Many of us
                    have grown up entranced by the uncanny clutter of the ersatz automaton workshops
                    in films such as Fritz Lang’s <hi rend="italic">Metropolis</hi> (1928), Ridley
                    Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Blade Runner</hi> (1982), or Tim Burton’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Edward Scissorhands</hi> (1990). Conversely, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art</hi> calls for only “The House of Mr. Patent” (193). No
                    automata, parts, nor tools are explicitly prescribed, excepting the
                    pseudo&#8211;automaton played by Freeman, and even his automaton costume seems
                    amateur&#8211;proofed. It consists of a “mask and domino,” and the automaton’s
                    mechanical nature appears merely via his stilted walk (197). Any Regency
                    bourgeois household would have been able to realize this stage effect. </p>
                <p>Domestic thespians would also be able to cope with the musical requirements of
                    the piece. The script calls for Maria’s song to be performed by or as a
                    “symphony” (201), but in the early nineteenth century, this word did not
                    necessarily imply a full orchestra. Another common meaning was “music in parts,”
                    involving multiple performers, or simply “concerted or harmonious music.”<ptr
                        target="#note11" xml:id="nr11" n="11"/> A few members of a family and their
                    guests could easily provide this incidental music. As this scenario seems most
                    likely in a bourgeois domestic setting, where an appropriate amount of leisure
                    time would exist, the play makes its plea on behalf of artisans alienated by
                    industrialism to the middle class.</p>

                <p>Having reconstructed some Regency contexts of <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi>, we must now turn to the play’s “second story.” “There is always a
                    second story about a published primary text,” observes the historian James P.
                    McClure: <quote>[I]t always involves at least one textual scholar or documentary
                        editor (whether or not so&#8211;called) [...] As far as the users of the
                        texts are concerned, the second story is often invisible, and its creators
                        [...] are anonymous.<ptr target="#note12" xml:id="nr12" n="12"/></quote><hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s “second story” is that of its original
                    editor, James Malcolm Rymer. What aspects of this play of 1820 might have
                    persuaded him to publish it in August 1842? The answer might be in part
                    thematic. From a young age, Rymer <hi rend="italic">fils</hi> found himself torn
                    between vocations in applied “science” and imaginative art. As I have noted, he
                    was raised by a creative family. Malcolm Rymer wrote literature and produced
                    engravings. Malcolm’s wife Louisa Rymer (née Dixon), James Malcolm’s mother,
                    worked as a milliner, making hats and accessories. Several of their children
                    were artists, too. James Malcolm Rymer’s brothers Chadwick and Gaven (or Gavin)
                    were visual artists and engravers (Collins viii). Three original engravings
                    signed by Gaven Rymer (1834) reside in the collection of the Guildhall.<ptr
                        target="#note13" xml:id="nr13" n="13"/>
                </p>
                <p>Another engraver brother, Thomas, James Malcolm’s junior by two years, achieved
                    considerable artistic fame on two continents. In 1838, he stood trial for
                    forgery at the Old Bailey, London’s central criminal court. He was accused of
                    engraving a one&#8211;pound banknote to create a fiver&#8212;a considerable sum
                    in those days. He was found guilty and transported to Van Diemen’s Land for
                    life. There and on the Australian mainland, he intermittently practiced
                    engraving and forgery for decades. Repeatedly convicted of using his engraving
                    knowledge to forge banknotes, he essentially dared the authorities to catch and
                    keep him.<ptr target="#note14" xml:id="nr14" n="14"/> In 1865, during his final
                    criminal trial, <hi rend="italic">Bell’s Life in Sydney and Sporting
                        Chronicle</hi> facetiously called him “an artist of great <hi rend="italic"
                        >note</hi>,” but this was not far from the truth, given his oft&#8211;tested
                        ingenuity.<ptr target="#note15" xml:id="nr15" n="15"/> Via criminal
                    creativity, Thomas Rymer fit into the artistic, fiction&#8211;making family that
                    he would never again see. </p>
                <p>Like Malcolm, Chadwick, Gaven, and Thomas Rymer, James Malcolm Rymer initially
                    learned the art and science of engraving. He also further entrenched himself in
                    the Rymer clan by marrying a paternal cousin, Caroline Huttly, in 1839. But he
                    was also carving out a new path. He became a civil engineer (Collins viii). In
                    1840, he registered a patent for engraved furniture castors. The engraving, he
                    argued, increased the castors’ friction, making it harder for the furniture to
                    shift about the floor.<ptr target="#note16" xml:id="nr16" n="16"/> In 1842, he
                    embarked upon a career that combined science, literature, and art by founding
                    the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>. In it, he published an engraving of
                    himself, apparently by the illustrator Thomas Onwhyn. In this portrait, James
                    Malcolm Rymer appears a distinguished, editor and writer, sitting in a wing
                    chair before a pile of books, including a volume of Shakespeare, and conversing
                    with an ethereal, hovering, female “spirit of the age,” perhaps in homage to
                    William Hazlitt's 1825 literary caricature series of the same title (Figure 2).
                    In the Prospectus published with the first number (April 1842), James Malcolm
                    Rymer promised a miscellany. The magazine would “consist of forty pages of
                    original material, comprising Romance—Poetry—Character—Burlesque […]
                    Music—Art—Science and General Literature.” He made good on this vow. The
                    magazine’s contents eventually included original fiction, such as the earliest
                    instalments of one of his earliest bloods (<hi rend="italic">Jane Shore, an
                        Historical Romance,</hi> completed in 1846), as well as poetry, drama,
                    engravings of paintings, and a regular column on “Useful and Important
                    Inventions.” The first (and, ultimately, only) instalment of this column
                    showcased a new, controversial method of engraving, “Mr. E. Palmer’s Patent
                    Electrotint,” which Rymer presents as a productive marriage of science and
                    art—like his magazine (31).</p>
                
                    <p>In editing this periodical, James Malcolm Rymer follows in his father’s
                    footsteps politically by championing reform. Although James Malcolm Rymer would
                    ultimately make his name by supplying fiction to newspapers priced at one penny,
                    an expense affordable to working&#8211;class readers, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Queen’s Magazine</hi> cost a shilling per number, as its title&#8211;page
                    advertises. Its textual contents corroborate that Rymer envisioned it as
                    middle&#8211;class aspirational literature that also reached out to other
                    demographics. The Prospectus identifies it as “A Family Magazine of the Highest
                    Class,” and informs “respectable Advertisers” that it will have “a <hi
                        rend="italic">certain</hi> large circulation in a high class of society,
                    quite independent of the popular patronage it is fairly presumed it will receive
                    from a Public, who at no period of English history were so fitted as now to
                    judge of sterling literary pretensions.” In the magazine’s first number (April,
                    1842), James Malcolm Rymer exhorts his middle&#8211;class readers to pursue
                    reform, opposing aristocratic tyranny. In the magazine’s major fiction serial,
                    the aforementioned <hi rend="italic">Jane Shore, </hi> he contends that “with an
                    intelligent and educated people,” the “incessant petty jealousies” and “eternal
                    feuds” of the “nobility [...] would [...] ensure [...] their extinction as a
                    class” (5). This sort of rhetoric renders the shilling periodical a tool of
                    general political reform, which was needed in the summer of 1842, in the
                    aftermath of the failure of the Second Chartist Petition (May) and during the
                    build&#8211;up to the August general strike. <hi rend="italic">Jane Shore</hi>
                    reinforces the impression that Rymer believed that meaningful reform needed
                    middle&#8211;class support. Moreover, the title of <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Magazine</hi> suggests that Victoria herself supported the periodical’s
                    agenda, though in fact she had no discernible connection to it.</p>
                    
                    <p>James Malcolm Rymer reinforced the periodical’s progressive agenda in part by
                    publishing <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>. In the Chartist era, the
                    play’s concern with the displacement of the human worker by machines remained
                    immediate. On March 16, 1839, an editorial in the Chartist newspaper <hi
                        rend="italic">The Northern Star</hi> articulated the widely held conviction
                    that “the progress of machinery has been so rapid, so unchecked, and so
                    self&#8211;protecting [...] that those who have been engaged in the pursuit
                    have, as if by magic, become the monied aristocracy of the country.”<ptr
                        target="#note17" xml:id="nr17" n="17"/> On February 21, 1846, the same
                    newspaper looked back across the 1840s and pronounced that “machinery had
                    pounced upon us with such an unexpected hop, step, and jump that society was
                    compelled to submit to such laws as regulations that its owners thought proper
                    to impose” (342&#8211;3).<ptr target="#note18" xml:id="nr18" n="18"/> As we have
                    seen, <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> makes the dangers of industrial
                    capitalism apparent to the middle&#8211;class Briton by showing lawyers
                    threatened by labor&#8211;saving machines. </p><p>Another reason why James Malcolm Rymer might have dusted off <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> of August 1842
                    involves the script’s accidental germaneness to a topical controversy of that
                    summer. In the summer of 1842, Patent may have resembled the inventor Charles
                    Babbage (1791&#8211;1871), whose “calculating engines,” the “Difference Engine” and
                    “Analytical Engine,” were then in development and are now widely considered
                    ancestors of the modern computer. During the summer of 1842, Babbage publicly
                    faced the greatest challenge of his career, as the government considered whether
                    to renew the funding of his calculating engines project, which they had begun to
                    support financially in 1833. These engines were then known as automata. In a
                    letter of 1823, Home Secretary Robert Peel called the Difference Engine a
                    “scientific automaton.” <ptr target="#note19" xml:id="nr19" n="19"/> Therefore,
                    Babbage and Patent invent the same sort of machine. Indeed, while Patent
                    “invents the wheels” and “axes” (191) and the automaton&#8211;Freeman walks as
                    if “full of wheels” (193), the science popularizer Dionysius Lardner, describing
                    the calculating engines in an <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> article
                    that Babbage helped him to prepare, claimed that the “project of a Calculating
                    Engine” aimed to “substitute an automaton for a compositor” and to “throw the
                    powers of wheel&#8211;work into thought,” which “could not fail to awaken the
                    attention of the world” (50&#8211;1).<ptr target="#note20" xml:id="nr20" n="20"
                    /> In Babbage’s two major Difference Engine models, writes the computer
                    scientist Allan G. Bromley, the originator of the Science Museum’s 1985&#8211;91
                    construction of the first complete, function Difference Engine, “the digits of
                    numbers are represented by the positions of wheels (figure wheels) rotating on
                    vertical axes” (30).<ptr target="#note21" xml:id="nr21" n="21"/> In early
                    twentieth&#8211;century America (ca. 1906) Dwight Goddard’s encyclopedia of <hi
                        rend="italic">Eminent Engineers […] Who Did Most to Further Human
                        Progress</hi>, a publication initially commissioned by the Wyman and Gordon
                    Company&#8212;Cleveland and Worcester, Massachusetts&#8211;based “manufacturers
                    of drop forgings”&#8212;finds Babbage’s engines labyrinths of “wheels within
                    wheels.” Goddard states that Babbage “spoke of 1,000 columns with 50 wheels each
                    in the store alone, and, besides, many thousand wheels mounted on axles in
                    columns for the mill and a vast machinery of cams and cranks for the control”
                        (253).<ptr target="#note22" xml:id="nr22" n="22"/>
                </p>
                <p>Babbage’s utopian dreaming and overtures to the government also distinguish
                    Patent. His plans to make the army, navy, and legal system more efficient by
                    replacing human labor with automata recalls the critic Tamara Ketabgian’s apt
                    characterization of Babbage as an “technophilia[c]” who “idealizes the machine
                    as an empowering prosthesis for humans,” as in his <hi rend="italic">On the
                        Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</hi>, which problematically “bases its
                    guiding principle on the substitution of machinery for human limbs.”<ptr
                        target="#note23" xml:id="nr23" n="23"/> We have seen that the sailors
                    stationed at Portsmouth threaten to throw Patent “overboard for a rascal” (192).
                    No doubt some early&#8211;1830s compilers of nautical tables would similarly
                    have eagerly dunked Babbage. Scientifically literate readers of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> might have been expected to see Babbage
                    in <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>. </p>
                <p>If we choose to read <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s pompous, bumbling
                    Patent as an accidental <hi rend="italic">doppelgänger </hi>of Babbage, the
                    Rymers’ might appear a short&#8211;sighted vision of scientific revolution.
                    Patent stands in stark contrast to Babbage’s most famous literary doubling, in
                    Charles Dickens’s <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> (1857) which shows the
                    genius inventor Daniel Doyce vanquished by the bureaucratic idiocy of the
                    government “Circumlocution Office,” which finds Doyce a “notorious rascal,”
                    “guilty” of being “ingenious” and of “trying to turn his ingenuity to his
                    country’s service,” which “makes him a public offender directly.” <ptr
                        target="#note24" xml:id="nr24" n="24"/> However, Babbage may have deserved
                    the Patent treatment. The entire 1840s has long been known as the ‘Hungry
                    Forties’, and although the term was coined only in the twentieth century, it is
                    apt. Widespread working&#8211;class and indigent hunger preceded the Irish
                    Potato Famine (1845&#8211;7), and dominated both the nation and the national
                    consciousness throughout the period 1840&#8211;9. We cannot “underestimate the
                    political centrality of the debate on hunger” throughout this decade, writes
                    Peter J. Gurney (101).<ptr target="#note25" xml:id="nr25" n="25"/> Charlotte
                    Boyce adds that it was not only the working&#8211;class and radical press that
                    debated hunger in this decade: it was the entire nation (423).<ptr
                        target="#note26" xml:id="nr26" n="26"/> The causes were many: rural to urban
                    migration that obliterated many workers’ and children’s access to
                    home&#8211;grown food; the oppressive Poor Law and Corn Laws, the latter the
                    target of the Anti&#8211;Corn Law League; a series of crop failures, and
                    of course the three failed potato harvests of the mid&#8211;1840s. The food
                    crisis was impossible to ignore—unless, perhaps, one had designed a wondrous
                    machine and was monomaniacally focused on getting it built. That was Babbage’s
                    public image in many quarters, whether or not it was his reality. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Charles Babbage: Pioneer of the Computer</hi> (1982),
                    Babbage’s preeminent modern biographer Anthony Hyman makes a charitable
                    understatement: that “Babbage’s industrial interests and the possibilities of
                    commercial application of his calculating machines were quite unattractive” to
                    Peel (191).<ptr target="#note27" xml:id="nr27" n="27"/> This Prime Minister 
                    (1834&#8211;5 and 1841&#8211;6) had never liked the idea of a government&#8211;
                    funded calculating engine project. His 1823 letter had derided Babbage as an inhabitant of
                    “Laputa,” the levitating island of impractical mathematicians in
                    Jonathan Swift’s <hi rend="italic">Gulliver’s Travels</hi> (1726). </p>
                <p>In fact, this was a charitable view of Babbage’s political outlook, for he was
                    not a Laputian, but an outspoken political conservative. As Hyman points out,
                    Babbage’s published writings demonstrate that his idea of the “manufacturing
                    class […] included factory workers and factory owners’ collaborating to form a
                    “free market” (85). His <hi rend="italic">Economy of Manufactures</hi> appeared
                    “during the most widespread class struggles in England in the whole of the
                    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.” During those struggles, Babbage
                    “insist[ed] that working men should realize that their interests and those of
                    their masters were essentially in harmony” (115&#8211;6). Unsurprisingly, then,
                    the government only took measures to encourage Babbage’s completion of his
                    engines, to the tune of £17,000 of public money, during relatively conservative
                    periods. The Duke of Wellington proved his champion, but during the Peelite era,
                    Babbage’s political backing vanished (87). In 1842, when he requested a renewal
                    of his funding, it may have seemed that, surrounded by his fragmentary
                    wheel&#8211;work, he could not see suffering humanity beyond. Neither can <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s Patent, until he learns that the most
                    “perfect machine” in history is the human. </p>

                <p>By the autumn of 1842, James Malcolm Rymer had put the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Magazine</hi> behind him and thrown himself into the work of writing penny
                    bloods for the publisher Edward Lloyd. However, he did not forget <hi

                        >Mazeppa; or, the Wild Horse of the Ukraine </hi>, published by Lloyd in
                    1850, departs from its Byronic source by foregrounding a new character, a
                    pompous London inventor reminiscent of Patent. Mr. Peter Lumpus of High Holborn,
                    the self&#8211;described “original inventor of the royal patent
                    no&#8211;lace&#8211;anti&#8211;tag stays,” and “inflexible cravat,” travels
                    through Mazeppa’s exotic Eastern principality to peddle these wares to the
                    rumored nine hundred wives of the Sultan of Turkey. He finds rather more
                    adventure than he had anticipated. Like Patent, Lumpus is distinguished by great
                    confidence in his questionable inventions and a belief that they will captivate
                    an Oriental market. <ptr target="#note28" xml:id="nr28" n="28"/></p>
                <p>Aspects of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> also reverberate in James
                    Malcolm Rymer’s most enduring work, <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls,
                    </hi> which Lloyd serialized in his <hi rend="italic">People’s Periodical</hi>
                    in 1846&#8211;7 and then reprinted, in an expanded edition, in 1850. Both <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art </hi>and <hi rend="italic">The String of
                        Pearls </hi>take place in the world of London’s lawyers. While <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> opens in “Freeman’s lodgings in the
                    Temple,” and contains many jokes at the expense of profligate, avaricious, or
                    hypocritical barristers, <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls </hi>is set
                    largely in the same realm. Sweeney Todd keeps his shop in Fleet&#8211;street, in
                    the Temple Bar region. Some of the clients whom he “polishes off” are lawyers.
                    Todd’s apprentice, Tobias Ragg, had intended to become a lawyer, but, judged not
                    clever enough, goes to work for Todd instead. “I have gone into another line,”
                    he explains to a friend: “instead of being a lawyer, and helping to shave the
                    clients, I am going to shave the lawyers now.”<ptr target="#note29"
                        xml:id="nr29" n="29"/> He means that he will no longer cheat (“shave”)
                    clients, and accidentally tells the truth about Todd, who cheats the lawyers by
                    murdering them. <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls</hi> also attacks the
                    “young Templers,” or young lawyers, by representing them as a ravenous mob who
                    literally consume their fellow human beings. Close to the Temple, in
                    Bell&#8211;yard, Mrs. Lovett’s pie shop caters to crowds of young lawyers. There
                    is “a rush of the legal profession to obtain them.” The lawyers
                        arrive:<quote>mostly from Lincoln’s&#8211;inn […] bustling and striving,
                        although from the neighbouring legal establishments likewise there came not
                        a few; the Temple contributes its numbers, and from the more distant
                        Gray’s&#8211;inn there came a goodly lot. (17)</quote>The pies are
                    clandestinely made of the flesh of Todd’s murder victims and advertised as pork
                    or veal pies. The lawyers’ monstrous appetites for their fellow man suggests
                    that their profession is inherently vicious; that it consumes people, giving
                    nothing back. </p>
                <p>Another parallel between <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">The String of Pearls</hi> involves the two texts’ villains,
                    Patent and Sweeney Todd. We have seen that Patent is willing to upend society
                    and destroy many people’s livelihoods in the name of “saving.” When he speaks of
                    technological “improvements” to society, he means that he will save the elite
                    money. He does not think of the human cost of his inventions’ implementation,
                    just as he does not think of his ward’s feelings. Sweeney Todd can be read as a
                    hyperbolic version of this flawed inventor. Like Patent, he is an engineer, and
                    his inventions work something like clockwork. He revamps his shop to feature two
                    identical barber’s chairs affixed to a rotating section of the floor to move
                    through a secret trapdoor, dumping victims into the space below to be murdered.
                    This “mechanical arrangement” (616) is an industrial&#8211;age update of the
                    medieval Wheel of Fortune. James Malcolm Rymer, inventor of patent engraved
                    castors to move and stabilize furniture, envisioned this contraption as an
                    example of ingeniously evil engineering.</p>
                <p>Like Patent, Todd applies his evil ingenuity to industrial entrepreneurship. His
                    victims are processed by the few, miserable, exploited workers at Mrs. Lovett’s
                    “pie manufactory.” This factory makes Todd a wealthy industrialist only
                    pretending to be an independent artisan, for it is the source of most of his
                    profits. It is so productive: <quote>the retail part of Mrs. Lovett’s business
                        which took place principally between the hours of twelve and one, was by no
                        means the most important or profitable portion of a concern which was really
                        of immense magnitude, and which brought in a large yearly income
                        (58).</quote>The workers go mad when they learn that the meat they are
                    processing is human. While Patent’s automata threaten to take away British
                    people’s livelihoods, Todd’s “manufactory” morally corrupts them and destroys
                    their will to live. It is a sobering vision of industrial profiteering when all
                    pretense at ethics is removed. Finally, Todd recalls Patent in his sheer delight
                    at his own inventions. Viewing his machines and their mayhem, he frequently
                    emits a disturbing laugh. In short, while Patent invents automata without regard
                    for industrialism’s human cost, Todd goes a step further, personifying
                    diabolical ingenuity. In creating him, James Malcolm Rymer goes further than his
                    father, using materials from <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> to engineer
                    a resilient, mythic nightmare of industrial inhumanity.</p>

                            <head>Editorial Methodology</head>
                <p>This edition aims to make the text of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    published by James Malcolm Rymer in the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>
                    accessible, for the first time, to scholars. I aim also to supply theatre
                    practitioners with a useful acting edition of the script, because much that can
                    be learned about any play is more evident in performance than on the page. In
                    service of these two very different ends, my editorial method combines aspects
                    of documentary and critical editing. I began by creating a faithful
                    transcription of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art </hi>as published in the UNC
                    copy of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine.</hi> This transcription
                    preserved the punctuation and formatting idiosyncrasies and the typographical
                    errors of the original. Then, I introduced a few critical features to make the
                    text more accessible to readers, including theatre practitioners reading it out
                    loud without rehearsal, in what is known as a “cold reading.” I have amended
                    those typographical errors that interfere with the meaning or smooth oral
                    delivery of the material. In all cases, these amendations are annotated and the
                    original, erroneous text supplied in note form. Obviously missing words are
                    inserted, marked as such using the “supplied” tag, and distinguished in red font
                    with broken underline. I have also standardized the playscript format. In the
                    source text’s stage directions and dialogue headers, character names are
                    abbreviated and “Freeman” used to indicate only “Young Freeman,” but I have
                    silently amended this for clarity’s sake. While the original includes the
                    isolated word “Scene” at the top of each scene, I omit it, replacing it with a
                    numerical act&#8211;scene header. Brief character descriptions are added to the
                    “Dramatis Personae” to enable readers easily to visualize the characters and
                    distinguish them from each other. These new descriptions are presented in square
                    brackets to indicate that they were not part of the source text. Finally, while
                    the source text abruptly terminates with the final line of dialogue, my script
                    ends with the newly inserted, hence, bracketed, words “The End.”</p>
               <p>The footnotes aim to support the critical work of this introduction. They are
                    intended to make the text accessible to readers ranging from scholars of
                    nineteenth&#8211;century literature to undergraduates and theatre practitioners.
                    The notes relate the play to its Romantic and Victorian cultural contexts.
                    Additionally, my critical apparatus aims to reveal <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi>’s place in the neglected history of the Rymers of London. Scholars
                    of Victorian literature are familiar with prominent literary families, such as
                    the Brontës, Brownings, Rossettis, and Wildes. Whereas these luminaries are all
                    upper&#8211; or middle&#8211;class families, and largely active only during the
                    Victorian period, the Rymers of London were working&#8211;class men and women,
                    whose creative activity spanned not only the disciplines of “science and art,”
                    but the Romantic and early Victorian eras, presenting a challenge to the
                    longstanding periodization of nineteenth&#8211;century British literature, a
                    form of compartmentalization that obscures the radical and reform movements that
                    spanned the entire century and evolved during it. My hope is that access to the
                    text and some contexts of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> will help to
                    facilitate greater understanding of Malcolm and James Malcolm Rymer’s literary
                    works and will help in a small way to expedite their incorporation into the
                    nineteenth&#8211;century British literary canon and curriculum.</p>

                        Magnifience and European Ingenuity”: Clocks of Late Imperial China</hi> (Ann
                    Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001) offers a more nuanced, carefully
                    contextualized picture of the role of gift automata during the reign of the
                    Qianlong (“Ch’ien&#8211;Lung”) Emperor (r. 1735&#8211;96; d. 1799). Pagani
                    introduces the Chinese concept of <hi rend="italic">zimingzhong</hi>, or
                    “self&#8211;sounding bells,” which encompassed clocks, automata, and other
                    apparently self&#8211;acting clockwork devices (1). In the sixteenth through
                    nineteenth centuries, Western visitors presented Chinese emperors with <hi
                        rend="italic">zimingzhong</hi> as diplomatic gifts, and such objects came to
                    be strongly associated with Europe, to the point of being called <hi
                        rend="italic">xiwu</hi> (“western things”) or <hi rend="italic">qiqi</hi>
                    (“strange things,” 18&#8211;9). From the early eighteenth century through at
                    least 1879, the Chinese capitol at Peking (Beijing) maintained an Office of
                    Clock Manufacture (<hi rend="italic">Zuozhongchu</hi>), but clocks continued to
                    be imported from Europe (37). The Qianlong Emperor indeed embraced this
                    tradition, collecting various clocks and mechanical animals and people and
                    writing poems in praise of <hi rend="italic">zimingzhong</hi> (62&#8211;3).
                    Pagani’s research makes it clear that far from being an infantile
                    toy&#8211;collector, the Qianlong Emperor celebrated his diplomatic relations in
                    the form of their ritual objects.</note>
