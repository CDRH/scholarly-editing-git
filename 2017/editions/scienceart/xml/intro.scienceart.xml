                <head>Introduction</head>
            <byline>by Rebecca Nesvet</byline>
                <p>On July 24, 1820, an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">London Morning
                        Post</hi> announced “The Triumph of Mechanism.” In an exhibition room in the
                    Western Exchange, Bond Street, a man-shaped machine called “PROSOPOGRAPHUS, the
                    AUTOMATON ARTIST” was reportedly drawing perfect silhouettes of astonished
                    visitors and strategically placed portrait busts. European spectators had seen
                    other automata draw pre&#8211;programmed pictures, write the inventor’s name,
                    and play brief pieces of music, but Prosopographus was different. This
                    automaton’s output seemed neither predetermined by its inventor nor limited to a
                    narrow range of options. “[T]he only Automaton in the world that takes
                    Likenesses,” Prosopographus could complete “a Profile Likeness in one
                        minute.”<ptr target="#note1" xml:id="nr1" n="1"/> By 1825, the advertising
                    presented Prosopographus as an existential threat to the human artist. An ad
                    placed in the <hi rend="italic">The Theatrical Observer and Daily Bills of the
                        Play</hi> claimed that the “Automaton Artist [...] draws Likenesses with
                    more certainty,” or accuracy, “than is in the power of the living hand to
                        execute.”<ptr target="#note2" xml:id="nr2" n="2"/></p>
                <p>These ads played upon fears that were common during the Regency. In 1811&#8211;6,
                    the Luddites had protested the imposition of labor&#8211;saving machines upon
                    the weaving industry. In 1815, the Welsh utopian reformer Robert Owen condemned
                    the emerging factory economy and the machines that made it possible. The
                    son&#8211;in&#8211;law of a Scottish manufacturing industrialist, Owen saw
                    firsthand the effects of the “manufacturing system” upon the children who
                    constituted much of his father&#8211;in&#8211;law’s workforce. “Is it to be
                    imagined,” Owen asked, “that the British Government will ever put the chance of
                    a trivial pecuniary gain of a few, in competition with the solid welfare of so
                    many millions of human beings?”<ptr target="#note3" xml:id="nr3" n="3"/> The
                    answer was affirmative. The Luddites were suppressed, and Prosopographus
                    reminded Londoners that even skilled artists could find themselves replaced by
                    self&#8211;acting machines.</p>
                <p>The same warning is issued in an obscure playscript of 1820. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art, A Farce in Two Acts</hi> concerns a young London lawyer,
                    Jack Freeman, who falls in love with Maria, the ward of an inventor of automata,
                    Peter Patent. This industrial&#8211;age Pantalone intends to save the British
                    nation a great deal of money by replacing various entire professions with his
                    patent automata. Freeman gains access to Patent’s home by masquerading as an
                    automaton, in a performance choreographed by his friend Dick Lobby, another
                    unscrupulous lawyer. When Lobby brings the pseudo&#8211;automaton to Patent, the
                    confusion of machine with human creates comic mayhem, and forces Patent to
                    question his previous dismissal of the human in favor of the machine. Meanwhile,
                    the denouément hints that Freeman is not in fact a self&#8211;acting individual,
                    but a part of a social machine, for he has unwittingly pursued Maria in
                    accordance with a plan designed by others. </p>
                <p>Written by the critically neglected working&#8211;class London novelist, poet,
                    and engraver Malcolm Rymer, <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> is here
                    reprinted for the first time since the nineteenth century. It deserves scholarly
                    attention not only for its commentary on the Industrial Revolution, but for its
                    “second story”: that of the editor who facilitated its initial publication, the
                    author’s son James Malcolm Rymer (1814-84). In the 1840s&#8211;60s, James
                    Malcolm Rymer achieved considerable literary success by prolifically penning
                    “penny bloods,” or cheap fiction serials targeting working&#8211;class readers.
                    Rymer’s bloods included the <hi rend="italic">Dracula</hi> precursor <hi
                        rend="italic">Varney, the Vampyre, or the Feast of Blood</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">The String of Pearls, or the Barber of
                    Fleet&#8211;street</hi>, the earliest tale of the fictional entrepreneur,
                    machine&#8211;inventor, murderer, and early food&#8211;processing magnate
                    Sweeney Todd.<ptr target="#note4" xml:id="nr4" n="4"/> Before these triumphs,
                    however, James Malcolm Rymer published his father’s play <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art,</hi> without attribution, in the August, 1842 fifth and
                    final number of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>, his earliest known
                    publication. The play can therefore be read as a seminal text in James Malcolm
                    Rymer’s literary career and the group output of his intergenerational literary
                    family. As this introduction will show, <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    intriguingly anticipates key aspects of James Malcolm Rymer’s most successful
                    literary invention, the enduringly horrific, diabolically ingenious Sweeney
                    Todd. Quite possibly, the most transformative gift Malcolm Rymer gave his son
                    was his rage against the machines.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>“By Mr. M. Rymer&#8212;1820”</head>
                <p>  </p></div>
            <div>
                <p>It has very recently become possible to identify Malcolm Rymer as the author of
                        <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> and the composition date as 1820. The
                    play was unattributed and undated until October 2016, when the Louis Round
                    Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill acquired from
                    the London antiquarian book dealer Jarndyce and Company, specialists in penny
                    bloods and dreadfuls, a partial copy of the first volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>, edited by James Malcolm Rymer. This
                    volume contains four numbers of the magazine, dated May through August 1842. The
                    April number is missing. According to Jarndyce cataloguer and Rymer scholar
                    Helen R. Smith, this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> had
                    been in James Malcolm Rymer’s possession. Some of its contents bear handwritten
                    corrections. Rymer signed a theatre review and is also identified as the poet of
                    “Love’s Fables,” which the printed text attributes to “George Hillier
                        Fantome.”<ptr target="#note5" xml:id="nr5" n="5"/> An inscription at the top
                    of the first page of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art </hi> reads “By Mr. M.
                    Rymer&#8212;1820.” (190). I propose that this author is Malcolm Rymer. On the
                    title&#8211;page of his 1806 novel <hi rend="italic">The Spaniard, or the Pride
                        of Birth</hi>, he styled himself “M. Rymer.” As I have shown in a
                    contribution to <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> (forthcoming 2017),
                    Malcolm Rymer was the only imaginative writer called “M. Rymer” who was active
                    during the Regency or the early Victorian era. He used the abbreviation “M.
                    Rymer” for the bylines of two poems he published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Monthly Magazine</hi> in 1815 and 1818.<ptr target="#note6" xml:id="nr6"
                        n="6"/> These facts make it highly unlikely that an “M. Rymer” published by
                    Malcolm Rymer’s son would be intended to denote anybody else.</p>
                <p>Can we discern if the handwritten attribution to Malcolm Rymer is accurate? I
                    cannot at present identify the handwriting of the <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi> annotation. However, neither James Malcolm Rymer nor his father are
                    likely possibilities. The hand does not match James Malcolm Rymer’s signature on
                    the theatre review, nor Malcolm Rymer’s handwriting as represented by his 1818
                    inscription to his sister Helen Rymer in a presentation copy of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Spaniard </hi> that is now in the collections of the
                    University of California, Los Angeles. Nevertheless, it is improbable that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> attribution is a fiction or an error.
                    Malcolm Rymer was an extremely obscure author during his Regency heyday. To his
                    son’s Victorian target audience, he was entirely unknown. As he was never
                    famous, there is no reason for anyone to have forged evidence of his authorship,
                    in 1842 or at any subsequent time. His near-total obscurity in the 1840s also
                    militates against the author of the inscription erroneously attributing someone
                    else’s work to him.</p>
                <p>Could the play have been actually written by James Malcolm Rymer in the 1840s,
                    and misattributed to his father? This is improbable, as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art</hi> seems indeed to have been written in 1820, when James
                    Malcolm Rymer was only six years old. <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    references topical events of 1820. Prosopographus was on display then, and the
                    play also includes a joke about “the dissolution of Parliament” (192). One such
                    dissolution occurred in February 1820, subsequent to the death of King George
                    III in the month before. During the 1840s, however, Parliament was only
                    dissolved and general elections held in August 1841 (an entire year before the
                    play’s publication) and 1847. </p>
                <p>A recurring topical joke involves Lobby’s claim that Patent, the
                    London&#8211;based inventor of automata, is famous in Asia, and particularly
                    celebrated in China. This would have made sense in the early years of the
                    nineteenth century but not the 1840s because in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth century, London was the global export center for automata, largely on
                    account of the activity of a few automaton&#8211;makers, including James Cox and
                    the Swiss expatriates Henri&#8211;Louis Jaquet&#8211;Droz and his foster brother
                    Frédéric Leschot. Although some Jaquet&#8211;Droz&#8211;Leschot wares were
                    produced in their London workshop and some in Switzerland, Leschot confessed
                    that all were “engraved as though [made] in England, because it is the general
                    opinion that every thing of this kind [automata] made in that country is of
                    better workmanship” (132).<ptr target="#note7" xml:id="nr7" n="7"/> It was also
                    a common belief that the most zealous appreciators of such things were Chinese.
                    In the 1770s&#8211;90s, the Qianlong Emperor (d. 1799) was a frequent client of
                    this community of artisans. He became famous in Europe for his “apparently
                    insatiable” desire for automata and other London&#8211;made mechanical “toys”
                        (318).<ptr target="#note8" xml:id="nr8" n="8"/> By 1842, the deaths of the
                    Qianlong Emperor and the inventors here named had evaporated this international
                    trade network. </p>
                <p>Additional circumstantial evidence that <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>
                    dates to the early nineteenth century is the reference to “those who march into
                    the field at the arbitrary pleasure of a despot.” In 1820, Napoléon’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Grande Armée</hi> was a vivid living memory, but in 1842,
                    Britain demonized no singular martial despot. Also, the elderly Patent seems
                    more likely to have been a child of the eighteenth century than the nineteenth,
                    as he wears a wig long enough to appear to be caught up by the fake “automaton”
                    (197). The days of elaborate wig&#8211;wearing among men outside the legal
                    profession were much closer to 1820 than 1842. An old man in 1820, as Patent is,
                    could be accustomed to wigs; not so a Victorian. These details suggest that <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> was more likely composed in 1820 than
                    1842. </p>

                <p>Malcolm Rymer seems to have been concerned throughout his career about the
                    conflict between man and machine, science and art. His novel <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Spaniard </hi>pits an industrious, honest sixteenth&#8211;century
                    Madrid barber, Pedrosa de Leandrez, against the Inquisition. Temperamentally
                    unsuited to the tonsorial trade on account of his aversion to shedding blood or
                    causing pain, Pedrosa (as the novel calls him) eventually finds refuge in a more
                    liberal country: either “England or Holland,” the third-person omniscient
                    narrator noncomittally concludes.<ptr target="#note9" xml:id="nr9" n="9"/> A
                    closer look at this tale reveals a political agenda. <hi rend="italic">The
                        Spaniard</hi> pits a feeling artisan against the theory&#8211;driven
                    proverbial machine of the Inquisition, with its literal instruments of torture,
                    suggesting a criticism of the nascent Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p> In <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>, Malcolm Rymer more clearly represents
                    conflict between mechanical and artisanal ingenuity. “One would imagine that
                    [Patent] thought nothing right in this world, as his invention,” or ingenuity,
                    “is continually on the rack to make it better,” Lobby says. “I don’t know how
                    many machines he has invented,” nor “how many schemes he has proposed for the
                    good of the public” (192). In practice, Patent’s “machines” and “schemes” seem
                    unlikely to improve most people’s lives. Instead, they threaten human labor,
                    dignity, thought, and creativity. The first example of Patent’s ingenuity that
                    the play reveals is a nightmare&#8211;vision of labor disenfranchisement and
                    industrial warfare. In the first scene, Lobby tells Freeman that Patent:
                        <quote>[...] not long ago [...] published proposals for an automaton
                        manufactory, in which he explained the variety of uses those self–moving
                        machines might be put to, and what an immense saving of expense to the
                        nation to employ them. In the first place he contended, that the business of
                        an army, according to the system of modern tactics, might as well be managed
                        by automatons as real soldiers; this would be a wonderful saving, as it
                        would render [...] unnecessary almost the whole host of army agents, army
                        contractors, and barrack masters. (193)<ptr target="#note10" xml:id="nr10"
                            n="10"/></quote>In this monologue, Lobby concedes that an automaton army
                    would save lives, as its soldiers would not die and could be “repaired.”
                    However, Patent’s rhetoric is primarily economic. He rejoices in the “saving of
                    expense to the nation,” the “wonderful saving,” and is not concerned for the
                    livelihoods of the “whole host” of men rendered “unnecessary” by his
                    innovation.</p>
                <p>Patent’s subsequent scheme attacks the livelihood of members of the Royal Navy.
                    “When Old Patent went down to the fleet at <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName> to
                    publish his proposals, our brave tars [sailors] would have him thrown overboard
                    for a a rascal who wanted the enemy to get all the fighting to themselves.”
                    Patent then tries to market his automata to the political elite, for a decidedly
                    nefarious purpose. “he offered to manufacture some for a few wealthy noblemen,
                    who told him that if he could conceive to make them say aye and nay, they would
                    probably take a dozen or two, as they might have use for them upon the
                    dissolution of Parliament” (192). In other words, he offers to provide the
                    aristocracy with automated voters, whom they could control more easily than the
                    already small and privileged pre&#8211;Reform electorate. This moment suggests
                    that Patent’s automata cannot improve society, so long as the power to
                    commission, purchase, and operate them remains with those who resist reform. </p>
                <p>Malcolm Rymer reinforces this idea by making Parent wrest this power away from
                    the elite, although only for a moment. Rymer’s upper&#8211;class lawyer
                    characters are unconcerned about Patent’s disruptive potential until they
                    realize that his inventions could threaten their own livelihoods. When Patent
                    tells his friend, Freeman’s lawyer uncle (“Old Freeman”), that he intends to
                    develop a “scheme” to settle law cases “without delay or expense,” thereby
                    making lawyers unnecessary, Old Freeman erupts in self&#8211;concerned outrage.
                    “What? where would be the traffic, if all mankind were to settle their disputes
                    themselves? I say, where would be the cash?” (202). Lawyers would need to become
                    Luddites were the professions to become the targets of industrial improvement. </p>
                <p>The play’s comic resolution implies that mechanical innovation is not inherently
                    evil and that the boundary between human and machine is quite hazy. Freeman and
                    his uncle each don the automaton costume and, by the art of play&#8211;acting,
                    persuade Patent that they are the wondrous automaton. Here, therefore, art
                    triumphs over mechanical genius. When the ruse is exposed, Patent happily
                    accepts his ward’s marriage to Freeman, as it is the exact match he had intended
                    for her. This resolution uncomfortably implies that the rebellious young <hi
                        rend="italic">innamorati</hi> in fact behave as their elders had designed,
                    like the cogs of a machine. As the characters commemorate the engagement by
                    dancing, Patent offers to accompany them on his “newly invented
                    hurdy&#8211;gurdy” (207), a traditional Welsh musical instrument that contains a
                    wheel mechanism reminiscent of clockwork. While Patent must learn the
                    pseudo&#8211;automaton’s secret&#8212;that “the most perfect machine the world
                    ever saw” (202) is the human being&#8212;he is able to use his powers of
                    invention to celebrate love&#8212;which is to say, to celebrate the appreciation
                    of two humans for each other, above all other living and nonliving machines.</p>

                <p>Who, if anyone, was expected to perform <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>,
                    and what was its target audience? Malcolm Rymer appears to have designed <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> for domestic consumption, not
                    professional performance. It seems never to have been produced in the commercial
                    theatre, as journalism from 1819&#8211;60 records no notices for any public
                    performance. However, Regency Britain had a culture of home theatricals, such as
                    those described in Austen’s novel Mansfield Park (1814). <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art</hi> appears suited by design to this performance mode. The
                    specified settings are all either vague and featureless or domestic. For
                    instance, the first scene takes place in the high&#8211;living Freeman’s
                    “lodgings at the Temple.” This impressive landmark is represented by merely a
                    “two chairs and [a] table” (190). Likewise, Freeman meets Maria at the Opera at
                    Covent Garden, but we do not see this momentous meeting. Instead, it is
                    described in retrospect in Freeman’s dialogue with his servant Tom. </p>
                <p>The play’s depiction of Patent’s premises also suggests authorial acquiescence to
                    the limitations of domestic theatricals. The home of an eccentric inventor of
                    anthropomorphic automata would seem ripe for scenographic creativity. Many of us
                    have grown up entranced by the uncanny clutter of the rundown home automaton
                    workshops in Fritz Lang’s <hi rend="italic">Metropolis</hi> (1928), Ridley
                    Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Blade Runner</hi> (1982), or Tim Burton’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Edward Scissorhands</hi> (1990). Conversely, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Science and Art</hi> calls for only “The House of Mr. Patent” (193). No
                    automata, parts, nor tools are explicitly prescribed, excepting the
                    pseudo&#8211;automaton played by Freeman, and even his automaton costume seems
                    amateur&#8211;proofed. It consists of a “mask and domino,” and the automaton’s
                    mechanical nature appears merely via his stilted walk (197). Any bourgeois
                    household would have been able to realize this stage effect. Such a community
                    would also be able to cope with the musical requirements of the piece. The
                    script calls for Maria’s song to be performed by or as a “symphony” (201), but
                    in the early nineteenth century, this word did not necessarily imply a full
                    orchestra. Another common meaning was “music in parts,” involving multiple
                    performers, or simply “concerted or harmonious music” (<hi rend="italic"
                        >OED</hi>).<ptr target="#note26" xml:id="nr26" n="26"/> A few members of a
                    family and their guests could easily provide this incidental music. As this
                    scenario seems most likely in a middle-class domestic setting, where an
                    appropriate amount of leisure time would exist, the play makes its plea on
                    behalf of artisans alienated by industrialism to the growing middle class.</p>

                <p>Having reconstructed some Regency contexts of <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi>, we must now turn to the play’s “second story.” “There is always a
                    second story about a published primary text,” observes the historian James P.
                    McClure:
                <quote>[I]t always involves at least one textual scholar or documentary editor
                        (whether or not so&#8211;called) [...] As far as the users of the texts are
                        concerned, the second story is often invisible, and its creators [...] are
                        anonymous.<ptr target="#note11" xml:id="nr11" n="11"/></quote>
                <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s “second story” is that of its original
                    editor, James Malcolm Rymer. What aspects of this play of 1820 might have
                    persuaded him to publish this particular work of his father’s, in August 1842?
                    The answer might be in part thematic. From a young age, Rymer <hi rend="italic"
                        >fils</hi> found himself torn between vocations in applied “science” and
                    imaginative art. As I have noted, he was raised by a creative family. Malcolm
                    Rymer wrote literature and produced engravings. As Dick Collins has shown,
                    Malcolm’s wife Louisa Rymer (nee Dixon), James Malcolm’s mother, worked as a
                    milliner, making hats and accessories (viii). Several of their children were
                    artists, too. James Malcolm Rymer’s elder brother Gaven was a visual artist and
                    engraver. Three original engravings signed by him reside in the collection of
                    the Guildhall Museum.<ptr target="#note12" xml:id="nr12" n="12"/> Another
                    brother, Thomas, James Malcolm’s junior by two years, achieved considerable
                    artistic fame on two continents. An engraver like his father, in 1838 he stood
                    trial for forgery at the Old Bailey, London’s central criminal court. He was
                    accused of engraving a one&#8211;pound banknote to create a fiver&#8212;a
                    considerable sum in those days. He was found guilty and, in 1839, transported to
                    Van Diemen’s Land for life. There and on the Australian mainland, he
                    intermittently practiced engraving and forgery for decades. Repeatedly convicted
                    of using his engraving knowledge to forge banknotes, he essentially dared the
                    authorities to catch and keep him.<ptr target="#note13" xml:id="nr13" n="13"/>
                    In 1865, during his final criminal trial, <hi rend="italic">Bell’s Life in
                        Sydney and Sporting Chronicle</hi> facetiously called him “an artist of
                    great <hi rend="italic">note</hi>,” but this was not far from the truth, given
                    his oft&#8211;tested ingenuity.<ptr target="#note14" xml:id="nr14" n="14"/> Via
                    criminal creativity, Thomas Rymer identified himself as a scion of the artistic,
                    fiction&#8211;making family he would never again see. </p>
                <p>Like Thomas Rymer and the other Rymer men, James Malcolm Rymer initially learned
                    the art and science of engraving. He also further entrenched himself in the
                    London contingent of the Rymer clan by marrying a paternal cousin, Caroline
                    Huttly, in 1839. But he was also carving out a new path. He became a civil
                    engineer (Collins viii). In 1840, he registered a patent for engraved furniture
                    castors. The engraving, he argued, increased the castors’ friction, making it
                    harder for the furniture to shift about the floor.<ptr target="#note15"
                        xml:id="nr15" n="15"/> In 1842, he embarked upon a career that combined
                    science, literature, and art by founding the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Magazine</hi>. In it, he published an engraving of himself as a
                    distinguished, editor and writer, sitting in a wing chair before a pile of
                    books, including a volume of Shakespeare, and conversing with an ethereal,
                    hovering, female “spirit of the age” (Figure 2). In the Prospectus published
                    with the first number (April 1842), Rymer promised “[t]he Magazine will consist
                    of forty pages of original material, comprising
                    Romance—Poetry—Character—Burlesque […] Music—Art—Science and General
                    Literature.” He made good on this vow. The magazine’s contents eventually
                    included original fiction, such as the earliest instalments of one of Rymer’s
                    first bloods, (<hi rend="italic">Jane Shore,</hi> completed 1846), as well as
                    poetry, drama, engravings of paintings, and a regular column on “Useful and
                    Important Inventions.” The first (and, ultimately, only) instalment of this
                    column showcased a new, controversial method of engraving, “Mr. E. Palmer’s
                    Patent Electrotint,” which Rymer presents as a productive marriage of science
                    and art (31). In the magazine, he integrated his two disciplinary concerns.</p>
                
                    <p>With the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>, James Malcolm Rymer follows
                    in his father’s footsteps by attempting to interest the middle-class reader in
                    reform. Although James Malcolm Rymer would ultimately make his name by supplying
                    fiction to newspapers priced at one penny, an expense affordable to
                    working&#8211;class readers, the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> cost a
                    shilling per number, as its title&#8211;page advertises. Its textual contents
                    corroborate that Rymer envisioned it as middle&#8211;class aspirational
                    literature, while also reaching out to the socioeconomic elite and the wider
                    public. The Prospectus identifies it as “A FAMILY MAGAZINE OF THE HIGHEST
                    CLASS,” and suggests that its audience might even include members of the
                    socioeconomic elite. James Malcolm Rymer informs “respectable Advertisers” that
                    “the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> will have a <hi rend="italic"
                        >certain</hi> large circulation in a high class of society, quite
                    independent of the popular patronage it is fairly presumed it will receive from
                    a Public, who at no period of English history were so fitted as now to judge of
                    sterling literary pretensions.” </p>
                <p>In the first number of the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> (April, 1842),
                    James Malcolm Rymer exhorts his middle&#8211;class reading to pursue reform,
                    opposing aristocratic tyranny. In the magazine’s major fiction serial, the
                    historical romance <hi rend="italic">Jane Shore, an Historical Romance, by the
                        Editor,</hi> he contends that “with an intelligent and educated people,” the
                    “incessant petty jealousies” and “eternal feuds” of the “nobility [...] would
                    [...] ensure [...] their extinction as a class” (5). This sort of rhetoric
                    renders the shilling periodical a tool of general political reform, which would
                    have impressed his future publishers, the Chartists Edward Lloyd and G. W. M.
                        Reynolds.<ptr target="#note27" xml:id="nr27" n="27"/>It reinforces the
                    impression that Rymer believed that meaningful reform needed middle-class
                    support.</p>
                    
                    <p>He pursued that aim in part by publishing <hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi>. In 1842, the play’s
                    concern with the displacement of the human worker with machines built to serve
                    the interests of the industrialists remained immediate. On February 21, 1846, an
                    editorialist for the Chartist newspaper <hi rend="italic">The Northern Star</hi>
                    looked back across the 1840s and pronounced that “machinery had pounced upon us
                    with such an unexpected hop, step, and jump that society was compelled to submit
                    to such laws as regulations that its owners thought proper to impose”
                        (342&#8211;3).<ptr target="#note16" xml:id="nr16" n="16"/> As we have seen,
                        <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> makes the dangers of industrial
                    capitalism apparent to the middle-class Briton by showing lawyers threatened by
                    labor&#8211;saving machines. </p><p>Another reason why James Malcolm Rymer might have dusted off<hi rend="italic">Science and
                        Art</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine</hi> of August 1842
                    involves its apparently fortuitous commentary on a topical controversy of that
                    summer. In the summer of 1842, Patent may have resembled the inventor Charles
                    Babbage (1791-1871), whose “calculating engines,” the “Difference Engine” and
                    “Analytical Engine,” were then in development and are now widely considered
                    ancestors of the modern computer. During the summer of 1842, Babbage publicly
                    faced the greatest challenge of his career, as the government considered whether
                    to renew the funding of his calculating engines project, which they had begun to
                    support financially in 1833.<ptr target="#note17" xml:id="nr17" n="17"/>These
                    engines were then known as automata. Prime Minister Robert Peel called the
                    Difference Engine a “scientific automaton” (263).<ptr target="#note18"
                        xml:id="nr18" n="18"/> Therefore, Babbage and Patent invent the same sort of
                    machine. Indeed, while Patent “invents the wheels” and “axes” (191) and the
                    automaton&#8211;Freeman walks as if “full of wheels” (193), the science
                    popularizer Dionysius Lardner, describing the calculating engines in an <hi
                        rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> article that Babbage helped him to
                    prepare, claimed that the “project of a Calculating Engine” aimed to “substitute
                    an automaton for a compositor” and to “throw the powers of wheel&#8211;work into
                    thought,” which “could not fail to awaken the attention of the world”
                        (50&#8211;1).<ptr target="#note19" xml:id="nr19" n="19"/> In Babbage’s two
                    major Difference Engine models, writes the computer scientist Allan G. Bromley,
                    the originator of the Science Museum’s 1985&#8211;91 construction of the first
                    complete, function Difference Engine, “the digits of numbers are represented by
                    the positions of wheels (figure wheels) rotating on vertical axes” (30).<ptr
                        target="#note20" xml:id="nr20" n="20"/> In early twentieth&#8211;century
                    America (ca. 1906) Dwight Goddard’s encyclopedia of <hi rend="italic">Eminent
                        Engineers […] Who Did Most to Further Human Progress</hi>, a publication
                    initially commissioned by the Wyman and Gordon Company&#8212;Cleveland and
                    Worcester, Massachusetts&#8211;based “manufacturers of drop
                    forgings”&#8212;finds Babbage’s engines labyrinths of “wheels within wheels.”
                    Goddard states that Babbage “spoke of 1,000 columns with 50 wheels each in the
                    store alone, and, besides, many thousand wheels mounted on axles in columns for
                    the mill and a vast machinery of cams and cranks for the control” (253).<ptr
                        target="#note21" xml:id="nr21" n="21"/>
                </p>
                <p>Babbage’s utopian dreaming and overtures to the government also distinguish
                    Patent. His plans to make the army, navy, and legal system more efficient by
                    replacing human labor with automata recalls the critic Tamara Ketabgian’s apt
                    characterization of Babbage as an “technophilia[c]” who “idealizes the machine
                    as an empowering prosthesis for humans,” as in his <hi rend="italic">On the
                        Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</hi>, which problematically “bases its
                    guiding principle on the substitution of machinery for human limbs.”<ptr
                        target="#note22" xml:id="nr22" n="22"/> We have seen that the sailors
                    stationed at Portsmouth threaten to throw Patent “overboard for a rascal” (192).
                    No doubt some early&#8211;1830s compilers of nautical tables would similarly
                    have eagerly dunked Babbage, and scientifically informed readers of the magazine
                    might have seen Babbage in <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>. </p>
                <p>If we choose to read <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s pompous, bumbling
                    Patent as an accidental <hi rend="italic">doppelganger </hi>of Babbage, the play
                    becomes a short&#8211;sighted parody of the man who thought up the computer. It
                    appears in stark contrast to Babbage’s most famous literary doubling, in Charles
                    Dickens’s <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> (1857) which shows the genius
                    inventor Daniel Doyce vanquished by the bureaucratic idiocy of the government
                    “Circumlocution Office,” which finds Doyce a “notorious rascal,” “guilty” of
                    being “ingenious” and of “trying to turn his ingenuity to his country’s
                    service,” which “makes him a public offender directly.” <ptr target="#note23"
                        xml:id="nr23" n="23"/> However, Babbage may have deserved the Patent
                    treatment. The entire 1840s has long been known as the ‘Hungry Forties’, and
                    although the term was coined only in the twentieth century, it remains apt.
                    Widespread working&#8211;class and indigent hunger preceded the Irish Potato
                    Famine (1845&#8211;7), and dominated both the nation and the national
                    consciousness throughout the period 1840&#8211;9. We cannot “underestimate the
                    political centrality of the debate on hunger” throughout this decade, writes
                    Peter J. Gurney (101). Charlotte Boyce adds that it was not only the
                    working&#8211;class and radical press that debated hunger in this decade: it was
                    the entire nation (423).<ptr target="#note24" xml:id="nr24" n="24"/>The causes
                    were many: rural to urban migration that obliterated many workers’ and
                    children’s access to home&#8211;grown food; the oppressive Poor Law and Corn
                    Laws, the latter the target of the Peelite Anti&#8211;Corn Law League; a series
                    of crop failures, and of course the three failed potato harvests of the
                    mid&#8211;1840s. The food crisis was impossible to ignore—unless, perhaps, one
                    had designed a wondrous machine and was monomaniacally focused on getting it
                    built. That was Babbage’s public image in many quarters, whether or not it was
                    his reality. In <hi rend="italic">Charles Babbage: Pioneer of the Computer</hi>
                    (1982), Babbage’s preeminent modern biographer Anthony Hyman makes a charitable
                    understatement: that “Babbage’s industrial interests and the possibilities of
                    commercial application of his calculating machines were quite unattractive” to
                    Peel (191).<ptr target="#note25" xml:id="nr25" n="25"/> This Prime Minister had
                    never liked the idea of a government-funded calculating engine project, and as
                    early as his 1823 had derided Babbage as an inhabitant of “Laputa,” the
                    levitating island of impractical mathematical enthusiasts in Jonathan Swift’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Gulliver’s Travels</hi> (1726). </p>
                <p>In fact, this was a charitable view of Babbage’s political outlook, for he was
                    not a Laputian, but an outspoken political conservative. As Hyman points out,
                    Babbage’s published writings demonstrate that his idea of the “manufacturing
                    class […] included factory workers and factory owners’ collaborating to form a
                    “free market” (85). His <hi rend="italic">Economy of Manufactures</hi> appeared
                    “during the most widespread class struggles in England in the whole of the
                    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.” During those struggles, Babbage
                    “insist[ed] that working men should realize that their interests and those of
                    their masters were essentially in harmony” (115&#8211;6). Unsurprisingly, then,
                    the government only took measures to encourage Babbage’s completion of his
                    engines during relatively conservative periods. While the Duke of Wellington
                    proved his champion, during the Peelite era, Babbage’s political backing
                    vanished (87). It was in the post&#8211;reform 1830s that Babbage received over
                    £17,000 of public money but completed no engine. In 1842, when he requested more
                    public money, it may have seemed that, surrounded by his fragmentary
                    wheel&#8211;work, he could not see humanity beyond. Neither can <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s Patent, until he learns that the most
                    “perfect machine” in history is the human. </p>

                <p>By the autumn of 1842, James Malcolm Rymer had put the <hi rend="italic">Queen’s
                        Magazine</hi> behind him and begun writing penny bloods for Edward Lloyd.
                    However, he did not forget <hi rend="italic">Science and Art.</hi> Aspects of
                    this play reverberate in his most enduring work, <hi rend="italic">The String of
                        Pearls, </hi>which Lloyd serialized in his <hi rend="italic">People’s
                        Periodical</hi>in 1846&#8211;7 and then reprinted, in an expanded edition,
                    in 1850. Both <hi rend="italic">Science and Art </hi>and <hi rend="italic">The
                        String of Pearls </hi>take place in the world of London’s lawyers. While <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> opens in “Freeman’s lodgings in the
                    Temple,” and contains many jokes at the expense of profligate, avaricious, or
                    hypocritical barristers, <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls </hi>is set
                    largely in the same realm. Sweeney Todd keeps his shop in Fleet&#8211;street, in
                    the Temple Bar region. Some of the clients whom he “polishes off” are lawyers.
                    Todd’s apprentice, Tobias Ragg, had intended to become a lawyer, but, judged not
                    clever enough, goes to work for Todd instead. “I have gone into another line,”
                    he explains to a friend: “instead of being a lawyer, and helping to shave the
                    clients, I am going to shave the lawyers now.”<ptr target="#note28"
                        xml:id="nr28" n="28"/> He means that he will no longer cheat (“shave”)
                    clients, and accidentally tells the truth about Todd, who cheats the lawyers by
                    murdering them. <hi rend="italic">The String of Pearls</hi> also attacks the
                    “young Templers,” or young lawyers, by representing them as a ravenous mob who
                    consume their fellow human beings. Close to the Temple, in Bell&#8211;yard, Mrs.
                    Lovett’s pie shop caters to crowds of young lawyers. There is “a rush of the
                    legal profession to obtain them.” The lawyers arrive:<quote>mostly from
                        Lincoln’s&#8211;inn […] bustling and striving, although from the
                        neighbouring legal establishments likewise there came not a few; the Temple
                        contributes its numbers, and from the more distant Gray’s&#8211;inn there
                        came a goodly lot. (17)</quote>The pies are clandestinely made of the flesh
                    of Todd’s murder victims and advertised as pork or veal pies. The lawyers’
                    monstrous appetites for their fellow man suggests that their profession is
                    inherently vicious; that it consumes people, giving nothing back. </p>
                <p>A clearer parallel between <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> and<hi
                        rend="italic">The String of Pearls</hi> involves the two texts’ villains,
                    Peter Patent and Sweeney Todd. We have seen that Patent is willing to upend
                    society and destroy many people’s livelihoods in the name of “saving.” When he
                    speaks of technological “improvements” to society, he means that he will save
                    the elite money. He does not think of the human cost of his inventions’
                    implementation, just as he does not think of his ward’s feelings. Sweeney Todd
                    can be read as a hyperbolic version of this flawed inventor. Like Patent, he is
                    an engineer, and his inventions work something like clockwork. He revamps his
                    shop to feature two identical barber’s chairs affixed to a rotating section of
                    the floor to move through a secret trapdoor, dumping victims into the space
                    below to be murdered. This “mechanical arrangement” is an industrial&#8211;age
                    update of the medieval Wheel of Fortune (616). Rymer, inventor of patent
                    engraved castors to move and stabilize furniture, must have seen this
                    contraption as an example of ingeniously evil engineering.</p>
                <p>Like Patent, Todd applies his evil ingenuity to industrial entrepreneurship. His
                    victims are processed by the few, miserable, exploited workers at Mrs. Lovett’s
                    “pie manufactory.” This factory makes Todd a wealthy industrialist only
                    pretending to be an independent artisan, for it is the source of most of his
                    profits. It is so productive: <quote>the retail part of Mrs. Lovett’s business
                        which took place principally between the hours of twelve and one, was by no
                        means the most important or profitable portion of a concern which was really
                        of immense magnitude, and which brought in a large yearly income
                        (58).</quote>The workers go mad when they learn that the meat they are
                    processing is human. While Patent’s automata threaten to take away British
                    people’s livelihoods, Todd’s “manufactory” morally corrupts them and destroys
                    their will to live. It is a sobering vision of industrial profiteering when all
                    pretense at ethics is removed. Finally, Todd recalls Patent in his sheer delight
                    at his own inventions. Viewing his machines and their mayhem, he frequently
                    emits a disturbing laugh. In short, while Patent invents automata without regard
                    for industrialism’s human cost, Todd goes a step further, personifying
                    diabolical ingenuity. In creating him, James Malcolm Rymer goes further than his
                    father, using materials from <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> to engineer
                    a resilient, mythic nightmare of industrial inhumanity.</p>

                    documentary and critical editing. I began by creating a faithful transcription
                    of <hi rend="italic">Science and Art </hi>as published in the UNC copy of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Magazine.</hi> This transcription preserved the
                    punctuation and formatting idiosyncrasies and the typographical errors of the
                    original. Then, I introduced a few critical features to make the text more
                    accessible to readers, including theatre practitioners reading it out loud
                    without rehearsal, in what is known as a “cold reading.” I have amended those
                    typographical errors that interfere with the meaning or smooth oral delivery of
                    the material. In all cases, these amendations are annotated and the original,
                    erroneous text supplied in note form. Obviously missing words are inserted,
                    marked as such using the “supplied” tag, and distinguished in red font with
                    broken underline. I have also standardized the playscript format. In the source
                    text’s stage directions and dialogue headers, character names are abbreviated
                    and “Freeman” used to indicate only “Young Freeman,” but I have silently amended
                    this for clarity’s sake. While the original includes the isolated word “Scene”
                    at the top of each scene, I omit it, replacing it with a numerical
                    act&#8211;scene header. I have also added brief character descriptions to the
                    “Dramatis Personae” to enable readers easily to visualize the characters and
                    distinguish them from each other. These new descriptions are presented in square
                    brackets to indicate that they were not part of the source text. And while in
                    the source text, the script abruptly terminates with the final line of dialogue,
                    my script ends with the bracketed, newly inserted words “The End.”</p>
               <p>The footnotes aim to complete the critical work of this introduction. They are
                    intended to make the text accessible to readers ranging from scholars of
                    nineteenth&#8211;century literature to undergraduates and theatre professionals
                    who may wish to stage it. They relate the play to its Romantic and Victorian
                    cultural contexts. Moreover, my critical apparatus aims to reveal <hi
                        rend="italic">Science and Art</hi>’s place in the neglected history of the
                    Rymers of London. Scholars of Victorian literature are familiar with prominent
                    literary families, such as the Brontes, Brownings, Rossettis, and Wildes.
                    Notably, these are all upper&#8211; or middle&#8211;class families, and largely
                    active only during the Victorian period. Conversely, the Rymers of London were
                    working&#8211;class men and women, whose creative activity spanned not only the
                    disciplines of “science and art,” but the Romantic and early Victorian eras,
                    questioning the current fashionable periodization of nineteenth&#8211;century
                    British literature. It is my hope that access to the text and some contexts of
                        <hi rend="italic">Science and Art</hi> will help to facilitate greater
                    understanding of the Rymers’ work, individually and as a literary family, and
                    will support their eventual incorporation into the nineteenth&#8211;century
                    literary canon and curriculum.</p>

                    stereotype of the “insatiable” Eastern despot, Catherine Pagani offers a
                    more nuanced, carefully contextualized picture of the role of gift automata
                    during the reign of the Qianlong (“Ch’ien&#8211;Lung”) Emperor (r.
                    1735&#8211;96; d. 1799). Pagani’s <hi rend="italic">“Eastern Magnifience and
                        European Ingenuity”: Clocks of Late Imperial China</hi> (Ann Arbor:
                    University of Michigan Press, 2001), introduces the Chinese concept of <hi
                        rend="italic">zimingzhong</hi>, or “self&#8211;sounding bells,” which
                    encompassed clocks, automata, and other apparently self&#8211;acting
                    clockwork devices (1). In the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries,
                    Western visitors presented Chinese emperors with <hi rend="italic"
                        >zimingzhong</hi> as diplomatic gifts, and such objects came to be
                    strongly associated with Europe, to the point of being called <hi
                        rend="italic">xiwu</hi> (“western things”) or <hi rend="italic"
                            >qiqi</hi> (“strange things,” 18&#8211;9). From the early eighteenth
                    century through at least 1879, the Chinese capitol at Peking (Beijing)
                    maintained an Office of Clock Manufacture (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Zuozhongchu</hi>), but clocks continued to be imported from Europe
                    (37). The Qianlong Emperor indeed embraced this tradition, collecting
                    various clocks and mechanical animals and people and writing poems in praise
                    of <hi rend="italic">zimingzhong</hi> (62&#8211;3). Pagani’s research makes
                    it clear that far from being an infantile toy&#8211;collector, the Qianlong
                    Emperor celebrated his diplomatic relations in the form of their ritual
                    objects.</note>

                    and the creator of one of the most popular and enduring villains in English
                    literature,” presumably, Sweeney Todd. “If this were not a pay site,” Collins
                    teases, “I would tell you more.” See Dick Collins, “Comment on “Thomas Rymer”
