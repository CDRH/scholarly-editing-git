            <h3>Call for Editions &amp; Articles</h3> 
            
            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>Since  1979, <em>Documentary Editing</em> has been a premier journal in the field of  documentary and textual editing. Beginning with the 2012 issue (to be published  in late 2011), <em>Documentary Editing</em> will be renamed <em>Scholarly Editing:  The Annual of the Association for Documentary Editing</em> and will become an  open-access, digital publication. While retaining the familiar content of the  print journal, including peer-reviewed essays about editorial theory and  practice, the 2012 issue of <em>Scholarly Editing </em>will be the first to  publish peer-reviewed editions.</p>
            <h4>Call for Editions</h4> 
            <p>Even  as interest in digital editing grows, potential editors have not found many  opportunities to publish editions that fall outside the scope of a large  scholarly edition. We believe that many scholars have discovered fascinating texts  that deserve to be edited and published, and we offer a venue to turn these  discoveries into sustainable, peer-reviewed publications that will enrich the  digital record of our cultural heritage.</p>
            
            <p>If  you are interested in editing a small-scale digital edition of a single  document or a collection of documents, we want to hear from you.</p>
            
            <h4>Proposals</h4>
            
            <p>We  invite proposals for rigorously edited digital small-scale editions. Proposals  should be approximately 1000 words long and should include the following information:</p>
            
            <ol><li><strong>A description of content, scope, and  approach.</strong> Please describe the materials you will edit and how you  will approach editing and commenting on them. We anticipate that a  well-researched apparatus (an introduction, annotations, etc.) will be key to  most successful proposals.</li> 
                <li><strong>A statement of significance.</strong> Please briefly explain how this edition will contribute to your field.</li>
                <li><strong>Approximate length.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Indication of technical proficiency.</strong> With only rare exceptions, any edition published by <em>Scholarly Editing</em> must be in XML (Extensible Markup Language) that complies with TEI (Text  Encoding Initiative) Guidelines, which have been widely accepted as the de  facto standard for digital textual editing. Please indicate your facility with  TEI.</li>
                <li><strong>A brief description of how you  imagine the materials should be visually represented.</strong> <em>Scholarly Editing</em> will provide support to display images and text in an  attractive house style. If you wish to create a highly customized display,  please describe it and indicate what technologies you plan to use to build it.</li></ol>
            
            
            
            <p>All  contributors to <em>Scholarly Editing</em> are strongly encouraged to be members  of the Association for Documentary Editing, an organization dedicated to the  theory and practice of documentary and textual editing.  To become a member, go to  <a href="http://www.documentaryediting.org">www.documentaryediting.org</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Please  send proposals as Rich Text Format (RTF), MS Word, or PDF to the editors via  email (agailey2@unlnotes.unl.edu, ajewell@unlnotes.unl.edu) no later than  August 1, 2010 for consideration for the 2012 issue.
