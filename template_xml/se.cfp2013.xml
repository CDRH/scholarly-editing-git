                <p>As part of our commitment to publish the scholarly work of editors, we invite proposals for rigorously edited digital small-scale editions to be published in the peer-reviewed, open-access, digital journal, <hi rend="italics">Scholarly Editing</hi>. Proposals should be approximately 1000 words long and should include the following information:</p>
                
                <list><item><hi rend="bold">A description of content, scope, and  approach.</hi> Please describe the materials you will edit and how you  will approach editing and commenting on them. We anticipate that a  well-researched apparatus (an introduction, annotations, etc.) will be key to  most successful proposals.</item> 
                    <item><hi rend="bold">A statement of significance.</hi> Please briefly explain how this edition will contribute to your field.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">Approximate length.</hi></item>

Please indicate your facility with  TEI.</item>
                    <item><hi rend="bold">A brief description of how you  imagine the materials should be
                        visually represented.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Scholarly Editing</hi> will provide support to display
                        images and text in an  attractive house style. If you wish to create a highly customized display, 
                        please describe it and indicate what technologies you plan to use to build it.</item></list>
